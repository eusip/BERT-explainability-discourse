COVID-19	President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments.
COVID-19	You talked about taking a therapeutic.
COVID-19	I assume you're referencing Regeneron.
COVID-19	You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks.
COVID-19	Is that a guarantee?
COVID-19	It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance.
COVID-19	One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.
COVID-19	Can you tell us what companies?
COVID-19	Johnson and Johnson is doing very well.
COVID-19	Moderna is doing very well.
COVID-19	Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others.
COVID-19	And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.
COVID-19	Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now.
COVID-19	Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022.
COVID-19	Is your timeline realistic?
COVID-19	No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate.
COVID-19	I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics.
COVID-19	And this is a very easy distribution for him.
COVID-19	He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.
COVID-19	Vice President Biden, your reaction?
COVID-19	Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government.
COVID-19	What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?
COVID-19	Make sure it's totally transparent.
COVID-19	Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes.
COVID-19	And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time.
COVID-19	This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer.
COVID-19	We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.
COVID-19	President Trump, your reaction?
COVID-19	He says you have no plan.
COVID-19	I don’t think it’s going to be a dark winter at all.
COVID-19	We're opening up our country.
COVID-19	We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning.
COVID-19	When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon.
COVID-19	Now he's saying, ‘Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.’ But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me.
COVID-19	And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster.
COVID-19	Far less lethal.
COVID-19	But it was a total disaster.
COVID-19	Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease.
COVID-19	Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said ‘It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.’ Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this.
COVID-19	Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.
COVID-19	Vice President Biden, your response?
COVID-19	My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China.
COVID-19	And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that.
COVID-19	In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was.
COVID-19	What did the President say in January?
COVID-19	He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent.
COVID-19	We owe hkim a debt of gratitude.
COVID-19	We have to thank him.
COVID-19	And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people.
COVID-19	And again, I go back to this, he had nothing.
COVID-19	He did virtually nothing.
COVID-19	And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, ‘Oh, don't worry.
COVID-19	This is all going to be over soon.’ Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon.
COVID-19	President Trump, your reaction?
COVID-19	I did not say over soon.
COVID-19	I say we're learning to live with it.
COVID-19	We have no choice.
COVID-19	We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does.
COVID-19	He has the ability to lock himself up.
COVID-19	I don’t know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement.
COVID-19	People can’t do that.
COVID-19	By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that.
COVID-19	I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears.
COVID-19	I can't do that.
COVID-19	And here’s — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything.
COVID-19	I said, you know, this is dangerous.
COVID-19	And you catch it.
COVID-19	And you know, I caught it.
COVID-19	I learned a lot.
COVID-19	I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals.
COVID-19	And now, I recovered.
COVID-19	99.9 of young people recover.
COVID-19	99% of people recover.
COVID-19	We have to recover.
COVID-19	We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation.
COVID-19	And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it.
COVID-19	Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though.
COVID-19	Can I respond to that?
COVID-19	30 seconds please, and then I have a question.
COVID-19	Number one.
COVID-19	He says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it.
COVID-19	People are learning to die with it.
COVID-19	You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning.
COVID-19	That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone.
COVID-19	Learning to live with it?
COVID-19	Come on.
COVID-19	We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous.
COVID-19	When's the last time?
COVID-19	Is it really dangerous, still?
COVID-19	Are we dangerous?
COVID-19	Tell the people, is it dangerous now?
COVID-19	What should they do about the danger?
COVID-19	And you say, I take no responsibility.
COVID-19	Let me talk about —
COVID-19	Excuse me.
COVID-19	Very quickly.
COVID-19	I take full responsibility.
COVID-19	It's not my fault that it came here.
COVID-19	It's China's fault.
COVID-19	You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either.
COVID-19	It's China's fault.
COVID-19	They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves
COVID-19	Vice President Biden.
COVID-19	as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit.
COVID-19	The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — What happened?
COVID-19	What did the President say?
COVID-19	He said don't worry, it's going to go away, it’s going to be gone by Easter.
COVID-19	Don't worry, the warm weather.
COVID-19	Don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious.
COVID-19	A whole range of things the President said.
COVID-19	And even today, he thinks we are in control.
COVID-19	We're about to lose 200,000 more people
COVID-19	President Trump.
COVID-19	Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this.
COVID-19	When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed.
COVID-19	And that went on for months.
COVID-19	What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing.
COVID-19	She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco.
COVID-19	But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing.
COVID-19	You’re xenophobic.
COVID-19	I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China.
COVID-19	Now he says I should have closed it earlier.
COVID-19	It just Joe, it doesn't —
COVID-19	I didn't say either of those things.
COVID-19	You certainly did.
COVID-19	I talked about his xenophobia in a different context.
COVID-19	It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.
COVID-19	All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this.
COVID-19	He thought I shouldn't have closed the border.
COVID-19	That’s obvious.
COVID-19	Do you wanna respond to that quickly, vice president?
COVID-19	No.
COVID-19	OK, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this.
COVID-19	Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it.
COVID-19	What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?
COVID-19	What I would say is I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country.
COVID-19	It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they're concerned.
COVID-19	Those other concerns are real.
COVID-19	That's why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.
COVID-19	You haven't ruled out more shutdowns
COVID-19	Oh no, I'm not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards.
COVID-19	The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up.
COVID-19	More social distancing.
COVID-19	Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums.
COVID-19	Do not open until you get this under control, under more control.
COVID-19	But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely.
COVID-19	For example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open.
COVID-19	They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now
COVID-19	Let's talk about schools.
COVID-19	President Trump —
COVID-19	Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.
COVID-19	Please, and then I have a follow up.
COVID-19	Thank you, and I appreciate that.
COVID-19	Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him.
COVID-19	His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying.
COVID-19	They're dying.
COVID-19	And he supports all these people.
COVID-19	All he talks about is shutdowns No, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools.
COVID-19	And it's like, as an example, I have a young son.
COVID-19	He also tested positive.
COVID-19	By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away.
COVID-19	Young people, I guess it’s their immune system.
COVID-19	Let me follow up, President Trump.
COVID-19	You've demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely.
COVID-19	But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike.
COVID-19	What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?
COVID-19	I want to open the schools.
COVID-19	The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools.
COVID-19	We have to open our country.
COVID-19	We're not going to have a country.
COVID-19	You can't do this, we can't keep this country closed.
COVID-19	It is a massive country with a massive economy.
COVID-19	People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide.
COVID-19	There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before.
COVID-19	There's abuse, tremendous abuse.
COVID-19	We have to open our country.
COVID-19	You know I've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down.
COVID-19	He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.
COVID-19	Vice President Biden, your —
COVID-19	Simply not true.
COVID-19	We're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.
COVID-19	We ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open.
COVID-19	You need to be able to, for example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business.
COVID-19	You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another.
COVID-19	You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected.
COVID-19	You need to be able to trace.
COVID-19	You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we open safely.
COVID-19	And by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it.
COVID-19	Don't worry about it.
COVID-19	Come on.
COVID-19	President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly.
COVID-19	I will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to New York, ut's a ghost town.
COVID-19	It's a ghost town.
COVID-19	And when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying.
COVID-19	These are businesses with no money.
COVID-19	Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer.
COVID-19	I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic?
COVID-19	These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city.
COVID-19	For so many years, I loved it.
COVID-19	It was vibrant.
COVID-19	It's dying.
COVID-19	Everyone's leaving New York.
COVID-19	Vice President.
COVID-19	New York has lost more than 40,000 people.
COVID-19	11,000 people in nursing.
COVID-19	President Trump, what about —
COVID-19	When you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed.
COVID-19	Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything.
COVID-19	It's been like a prison.
COVID-19	Now it was just ruled unconstitutional.
COVID-19	Take a look at North Carolina.
COVID-19	They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially.
COVID-19	We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen.
COVID-19	We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them.
COVID-19	We have the best testing in the world by far.
COVID-19	That's why we have so many cases.
COVID-19	Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section.
COVID-19	President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, “a disaster.” You described him and other medical experts as “idiots.” If you're not listening to them, who are you listening to?
COVID-19	I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony.
COVID-19	I get along very well with Anthony.
COVID-19	But he did say, ‘don't wear masks.’ He did say, as you know, ‘this is not going to be a problem.’ I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay.
COVID-19	He said, ‘this is not going to be a problem.
COVID-19	We are not going to have a problem at all.’ When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others.
COVID-19	And I'm not knocking him.
COVID-19	Nobody knew.
COVID-19	Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was.
COVID-19	We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, ‘don't wear masks.’ Now he wants to wear masks.
COVID-19	Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words: ‘This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.’ So he's allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.
COVID-19	Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then we're going to move on to the next section.
COVID-19	My response is think about what the President knew in January and didn't tell the American people.
COVID-19	He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu.
COVID-19	He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us, didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic.
COVID-19	He didn't want us — Americans don't panic.
COVID-19	He panicked.
COVID-19	Well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, ‘this is a really dangerous thing,’ and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — had said, ‘sell short, because we gotta get moving.
COVID-19	It's a dangerous problem.’
COVID-19	Well this is —
COVID-19	I’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we're gonna move on.
COVID-19	I don't know if somebody went to Wall Street.
COVID-19	You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street.
COVID-19	I don't take it.
COVID-19	You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money.
COVID-19	And every time you raise money, deals are made.
COVID-19	I could raise so much more money.
COVID-19	As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record.
COVID-19	But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position.
COVID-19	And then you bring up Wall Street?
COVID-19	You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street.
COVID-19	Because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me.
COVID-19	I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe.
COVID-19	We don't need money.
COVID-19	We have plenty of money.
COVID-19	In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get.
COVID-19	Don’t tell me about wall street.
COVID-19	All right, gentlemen, we're gonna move on.
COVID-19	Average contribution, $43.
	
National Security	Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered.
National Security	Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia.
National Security	And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife.
National Security	He got three and a half million dollars.
National Security	Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half?
National Security	I never got any money from Russia.
National Security	I don't get money from Russia.
National Security	Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is a fantastic DNI — he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose.
National Security	Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia.
National Security	Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia.
National Security	Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO.
National Security	You know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against Russia.
National Security	I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine.
National Security	There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.
National Security	And I'll tell you, they were so bad.
National Security	They took over the, the submarine port.
National Security	You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama.
National Security	They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine.
National Security	You handed it to them.
National Security	But you were getting a lot of money from Russia.
National Security	They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse.
National Security	All of the emails, the emails are horrible.
National Security	The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family.
National Security	And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening.
National Security	And it should have never happened.
National Security	And I think you owe an explanation to the American people.
National Security	Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning.
National Security	And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people.
National Security	Maybe you can do it right now.
National Security	Vice President Biden, you may respond to follow up on the election security.
National Security	I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life.
National Security	We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money?
National Security	I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one.
National Security	Number two, this is a president — I have released all of my tax returns.
National Security	22 years.
National Security	Go look at them.
National Security	22 years of my tax return.
National Security	You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return.
National Security	What are you hiding?
National Security	Why are you unwilling?
National Security	The foreign countries are paying you a lot.
National Security	Russia is paying you a lot.
National Security	China is paying a lot.
National Security	And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world.
National Security	And China's building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas.
National Security	So what's going on here?
National Security	Why don't you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption?
National Security	President Trump, your response.
National Security	First of all, I called my accounts — under audit.
National Security	I'm going to release them as soon as we can.
National Security	I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is.
National Security	But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750.
National Security	I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay?
National Security	They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars.
National Security	I prepaid my tax.
National Security	Tens.
National Security	Over the last number of years.
National Security	Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate.
National Security	They think I may have to pay tax.
National Security	So, I already prepaid it.
National Security	Nobody told me that.
National Security	Did your accountant tell you —
National Security	Excuse me.
National Security	And it wasn't written whenever they write this.
National Security	They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee.
National Security	But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one.
National Security	Number two, I don't make money from China, you do.
National Security	I don't make money from Ukraine, you do.
National Security	I don't make money from Russia.
National Security	You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you.
National Security	They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man.
National Security	You're the big man, I think.
National Security	I don't know, maybe you're not.
National Security	But you're the big man, I think.
National Security	You son said that we have to give 10% to the big man.
National Security	Joe, what's that all about?
National Security	It's terrible.
National Security	All right, gentlemen, I want to ask you both some questions about all of this.
National Security	I'm gonna let you both respond, very quickly.
National Security	You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes.
National Security	Did he tell you when you can release them?
National Security	Do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the American people?
National Security	I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated.
National Security	A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly.
National Security	We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president.
National Security	I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done.
National Security	As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it.
National Security	But I have paid millions and millions of dollars.
National Security	And it's worse than paying.
National Security	I paid in advance.
National Security	It's called prepaying your taxes.
National Security	I paid.
National Security	I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly.
National Security	At some point I want to respond.
National Security	Respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question.
National Security	Why do he — He's been saying this for four years.
National Security	Show us.
National Security	Just show us.
National Security	Stop playing around.
National Security	You’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes.
National Security	Nobody knows, Mr. President, they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that are so low.
National Security	When last time he said what he paid, he said, ‘I only pay that little because I'm smart.
National Security	I know how to game the system.’ Come on, come on, folks.
National Security	Quickly, President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you.
National Security	I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years.
National Security	It started before I even got elected.
National Security	They spied on my campaign.
National Security	No president should ever have to go through what I went through.
National Security	Let me just say this.
National Security	Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent, $48 million.
National Security	They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong.
National Security	$48 million.
National Security	I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars.
National Security	Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe.
National Security	And they say you get some of it.
National Security	And you do live very well.
National Security	You have houses all over the place.
National Security	You live very well.
National Security	All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly.
National Security	Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President.
National Security	In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?
National Security	Nothing was unethical.
National Security	Here's what the deal.
National Security	With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong.
National Security	Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably.
National Security	I carried out US policy.
National Security	Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line.
National Security	Not a single thing, number one.
National Security	Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened.
National Security	My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — China.
National Security	I have not had it.
National Security	The only guy that made money from China is this guy.
National Security	He’s the only one.
National Security	Nobody else has made money from China.
National Security	Let me ask my question to you.
National Security	Could I just — one thing.
National Security	Very quickly.
National Security	His son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that.
National Security	And he didn't have a job.
National Security	As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month.
National Security	Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience.
National Security	That’s 100% dishonest.
National Security	I’m going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then I have a question for you.
National Security	No basis for that.
National Security	Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.
National Security	OK, President Trump, this is for you.
National Security	Since you took office, you've never divested from your business.
National Security	You've personally promoted your properties abroad.
National Security	A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China.
National Security	So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?
National Security	I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place.
National Security	I mean, I was a businessman doing business.
National Security	The bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013.
National Security	That's what it was.
National Security	It was opened.
National Security	It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it.
National Security	And I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.
National Security	OK.
National Security	Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that.
National Security	That was before.
National Security	So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference.
National Security	He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something —
National Security	We do need to move on.
National Security	I do want to ask you, Vice President Biden, about China.
National Security	Let's talk about China more broadly.
National Security	There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus.
National Security	If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like?
National Security	All right, let's talk about North Korea.
National Security	Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this.
National Security	OK, very quickly and then we're gonna have...
National Security	His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China —
National Security	Not true.
National Security	after spending 10 minutes in office and being an Air Force Two, number one.
National Security	Number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.
National Security	That is not true.
National Security	President Trump, on China policy, though.
National Security	What are you gonna do?
National Security	What specifically are you going to do to make China pay?
National Security	First of all, China is paying.
National Security	They’re paying billions and billions of dollars.
National Security	I just gave $28 billion.
National Security	Through sanctions?
National Security	I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.
National Security	Taxpayers money.
National Security	It’s what?
National Security	Taxpayers money.
National Security	No, the taxpayers.
National Security	It's called China.
National Security	Not true.
National Security	China pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe?
National Security	They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money?
National Security	Our farmers.
National Security	Our great farmers, because they would target it.
National Security	You never charge them anything.
National Security	Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry.
National Security	We were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry
National Security	OK, Vice President Biden, your response, please?
National Security	This isn't about me.
National Security	There's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey.
National Security	There's a reason for it.
National Security	He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues.
National Security	It's not about his family and my family.
National Security	It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly.
National Security	If you're making less than, if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly right now.
National Security	You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they’re bald, because we have to wait another month.
National Security	Or, so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage?
National Security	Who's going to tell her, she can't go back to community college?
National Security	They're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymot.
National Security	They're in trouble.
National Security	We should be talking about your families but that's the last thing he wants to talk about.
National Security	I wanted to say, I want to tell —
National Security	That is a typical statement.
National Security	Just 10 seconds, please.
National Security	10 seconds Mr President, 10 seconds.
National Security	Just a typical political statement.
National Security	Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything.
National Security	Just a typical politician when I see that.
National Security	All right, let’s talk —
National Security	I’m not a typical politician, that’s why I got elected.
National Security	Let’s talk about —
National Security	Let’s get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table.
National Security	Come on, Joe, you can do better.
National Security	We're gonna talk about North Korea now.
National Security	President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's three times.
National Security	You've talked about your beautiful letters with him, you've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal.
National Security	Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship?
National Security	Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic.
National Security	Vice President Biden, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration.
National Security	Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?
National Security	Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because here's the root.
National Security	I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, they said, ‘Why are you moving your missile defense up so close?
National Security	Why are you moving more forces?
National Security	Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea?’ I said, ‘Because North Korea is a problem.
National Security	And we're going to continue to do it so we can control them.
National Security	We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us.
National Security	And so if you want to do something about it, step up.
National Security	And help if not, it's going to continue.’ What has he done?
National Security	He's legitimized North Korea, he's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we're better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before.
National Security	Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden, you've said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions.
National Security	Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?
National Security	On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there.
National Security	The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.
National Security	All right, let's move on to American families.
National Security	Kristen, they tried to meet with him.
National Security	Very quickly.
National Security	10 seconds, President Trump.
National Security	They tried to meet with him, he wouldn’t do it.
National Security	He didn’t like Obama.
National Security	He didn’t like him.
National Security	He wouldn’t do it.
National Security	OK, I’ve got to give him a chance to respond.
National Security	They tried, he wouldn’t do it.
National Security	And that’s okay.
National Security	You know what, North Korea, we’re not in a war.
National Security	We have a good relationship.
National Security	You know, people don’t understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.
National Security	President Trump, we have to move on.
National Security	We have a lot of questions to get through.
National Security	We had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe, the rest of Europe.
National Security	Come on.
National Security	The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we’re gonna talk about denuclearization, we’re not gonna legitimize you, we’re gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you.
National Security	That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us.
National Security	And it didn’t happen.
National Security	Let’s move on and talk about American families.
National Security	Excuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen.
National Security	They left me a mess.
National Security	North Korea was a mess.
National Security	We need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, President Trump.
National Security	Remember the first two or three months.
National Security	There was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit.
National Security	They left us a mess, and Obama would be – I think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had.
	
Economy	I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden, it relates to something that President Trump said.
Economy	He's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine.
Economy	What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government?
Economy	What he’s saying, it's ridiculous.
Economy	It’s like saying that, you know, we're the idea that, the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes the socialist plan?
Economy	Look, the difference between the president -- I think health care is not a privilege, it's a right.
Economy	Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care.
Economy	And I am very proud of my plan.
Economy	It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field.
Economy	This is something that's going to save people's lives.
Economy	And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in God's name are you going to do if you get sick?
Economy	Because you've lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company's gone under.
Economy	We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what I do.
Economy	President Trump, your response.
Economy	Excuse me, he was there for 47 years -- he didn't do it.
Economy	He was now there as Vice President for eight years.
Economy	And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters.
Economy	It was just a little while ago, right?
Economy	Less than four years ago.
Economy	He didn't do anything.
Economy	He didn't do it.
Economy	He wants socialized medicine.
Economy	And it's not that he wants it, his vice president -- I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more, Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it.
Economy	You're going to have socialized medicine.
Economy	Just like you went on with fracking -- ‘We're not going to have fracking, we're going to stop fracking, we're going to stop fracking.’ Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination -- well he got very lucky to get it.
Economy	And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, ‘Oh, we're gonna have fracking.’ And you never asked a question.
Economy	And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say.
Economy	But by the way, somebody should ask the question.
Economy	He goes for a year --
Economy	We do have a number of -- we have a number of topics.
Economy	No, no, but that's a question --
Economy	We're gonna get to it --
Economy	It’s the same thing with socialized medicine.
Economy	Vice President, your response.
Economy	My response is people deserve to have affordable health care -- period.
Economy	Period, period, period.
Economy	And the Bidencare proposal will, in fact, provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums.
Economy	What we're going to do is going to cost some money; it's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it.
Economy	And they're going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly.
Economy	He keeps talking about it.
Economy	He hasn't done a thing for anybody on health care, not a thing.
Economy	Kristen, when he says --
Economy	Very quickly, then I want to talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill
Economy	When he says public health option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care.
Economy	When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying -- he’s destroying your Social Security.
Economy	And this whole country will come down.
Economy	You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state.
Economy	His governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work --
Economy	Let's see if --
Economy	-- it was impossible --
Economy	Vice President Biden, your response.
Economy	He thinks he's running against someone else.
Economy	He's running against Joe Biden.
Economy	I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them.
Economy	Joe Biden, he's running against.
Economy	And the idea that we're in a situation and want to destroy Medicare -- this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, ‘If in fact’ -- and, social security -- ‘If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to pay for it.
Economy	This is a guy who's tried to cut Medicare.
Economy	So I don't know.
Economy	I mean, the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare?
Economy	Come on.
Economy	He tried to get rid of --
Economy	Vice Presiden, Mr. President, I’m going to have to go on to another question --
Economy	-- he tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago.
Economy	Go back and look at the records.
Economy	He tried to hurt Social Security you've got --
Economy	All right, let’s move on to the next question.
Economy	They say the stock market will rule if I'm elected.
Economy	If he's elected, the stock market will crash.
Economy	OK, let's move on to the next question.
Economy	May I respond?
Economy	Very quickly.
Economy	The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening.
Economy	Where I come from, in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market.
Economy	Just in the last three, three years during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to the Wall Street, $700 billion more dollars.
Economy	$700 billion more dollars.
Economy	Because that's his only measure.
Economy	What happens to the ordinary people out there?
Economy	What happens to them?
Economy	401k’s are through the roof.
Economy	401k --
Economy	All right, let’s move on.
Economy	-- are through the roof.
Economy	And he doesn't come from Scranton.
Economy	That's like, what --  he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew --
Economy	We're gonna move on --
Economy	And he left.
Economy	And the people of Pennsylvania will tell you that.
Economy	to my next question, gentlemen.
Economy	As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work.
Economy	And as of tonight, 8 million more homes have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day.
Economy	Those hit hardest are women and people of color.
Economy	They see Washington fighting over a relief bill.
Economy	Mr. President, why haven't you been able to get them the help they  need?
Economy	30 seconds here.
Economy	Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it.
Economy	I do.
Economy	But you're the president.
Economy	I do.
Economy	But I still have to get, unfortunate -- that's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her.
Economy	Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything.
Economy	She'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3.
Economy	Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it.
Economy	We are ready, willing and able to do something.
Economy	Don't forget, we've already approved three plans.
Economy	And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness.
Economy	This one she doesn't want.
Economy	It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically.
Economy	I think it hurts her politically.
Economy	All right, Mr. Vice President --
Economy	You know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can't -- he will not pass it.
Economy	He does not have Republican votes.
Economy	Why isn’t he talking to his Republican friends?
Economy	Let me follow up with you, Vice President
Economy	If we made a deal, we’d have --
Economy	Let me ask Vice President Biden the question.
Economy	You are the leader of the Democratic Party.
Economy	Why have you not [] Democrats to get a deal for the American people?
Economy	Well, I have and they have pushed it.
Economy	Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer.
Economy	This is like -- it's not new.
Economy	It's been out there.
Economy	The HEROES Act has been sitting there.
Economy	And look at what's happening.
Economy	When I was in charge of the Recovery Act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets, so then they have to fire fire -- they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they can keep their cities and counties running.
Economy	He will not support that.
Economy	They have not done a thing for them.
Economy	And Mitch McConnell said, ‘Let him go bankrupt.
Economy	Let him go bankrupt.’ Come on.
Economy	What's the matter with these --
Economy	I want --
Economy	All right, if I get elected, I'm not gonna -- I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president.
Economy	I don't see red states and blue states.
Economy	What I see is American United States.
Economy	And folks, every single state out there finds themselves in trouble.
Economy	They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue.
Economy	Cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers -- because they have to balance their budget.
Economy	And the founders were smart.
Economy	They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.
Economy	I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen.
Economy	Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners today.
Economy	Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage?
Economy	You, of course, support a $15 minimum wage.
Economy	I do, because I think one of the things we’re gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too.
Economy	We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses.
Economy	You’ve got one in six of them going under.
Economy	They're not going to be able to make it back.
Economy	They passed a package that allows us to be able to call PPP, money that’s supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely.
Economy	Schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in.
Economy	They need the help, the businesses, as well as the schools, need the help.
Economy	But this, these guys will not help them.
Economy	He is not giving them any of the money.
Economy	We are going to move on --
Economy	For small businesses -- by raising the minimum wage and helping, I think it should be a state option.
Economy	Alabama is different than New York, New York is different from Vermont.
Economy	Every state is different.
Economy	It should be a state option.
Economy	So it's very important.
Economy	We have to help our small business --
Economy	You said --
Economy	How are you helping small businesses, when you're forcing wages.
Economy	What's going to happen and what's been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen
Economy	Well you said you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour --
Economy	Say again?
Economy	You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
Economy	Is that still the case?
Economy	What I’d really like, I would consider it to an extent.
Economy	I really like what I -- in a second administration -- but not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business.
Economy	It should be a state option.
Economy	Look, I have a read on different places, I know different places.
Economy	They’re all different.
Economy	Some places, $15 is not so bad.
Economy	In other places, other states, $15 --
Economy	OK, President Trump, thank you.
Economy	Quick response, Vice President Biden
Economy	Two jobs, one job below poverty.
Economy	People are making 6, 7, 8 bucks an hour.
Economy	These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street, because they've allowed us to make it.
Economy	What's happening?
Economy	They deserve a minimum wage of $15.
Economy	Anything below that put you below the poverty level.
Economy	And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, business has gone out of business.
Economy	That is simply not true.
	
Immigration	Let me just say.
Immigration	They built cages.
Immigration	You know, they used to say I built the cages.
Immigration	And then they had a picture in the newspaper.
Immigration	There was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, ‘Look at these cages, President Trump built them.’ And then it was determined they were built in 2014.
Immigration	That was him.
Immigration	Do you have a plan to reunite the kids?
Immigration	Yes, we're working on a very -- we're trying very hard.
Immigration	But a lot of these kids come up without the parents, they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs.
Immigration	Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation.
Immigration	Quick response and then another question to you.
Immigration	These 500 plus kids came with parents.
Immigration	They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with.
Immigration	Big real tough, really strong.
Immigration	And guess what?
Immigration	They cannot -- it’s not coyotes that bring them over, their parents were with them.
Immigration	They got separated from their parents.
Immigration	And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every judge of who we are as a nation.
Immigration	Let me ask you a follow up --
Immigration	Kristen, they did it, we changed the policy.
Immigration	They did it.
Immigration	We changed it.
Immigration	They set up the cages.
Immigration	They -- who built the cages?
Immigration	So let's talk about --
Immigration	Who built the cages, Joe?
Immigration	Let’s talk about what we’re talking about.
Immigration	What happened?
Immigration	Parents were ripped -- their kids were ripped from their arms and separated.
Immigration	And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone.
Immigration	Nowhere to go, nowhere to go.
Immigration	It's criminal.
Immigration	It's criminal.
Immigration	Let me just --
Immigration	Let me say this.
Immigration	They worked it out, we brought reporters and everything.
Immigration	They are so well taken care of.
Immigration	They're in facilities that were so clean --
Immigration	But some of them haven’t been reunited --
Immigration	But just answer one question.
Immigration	Who built the cages?
Immigration	A big ask of that, who built the cages?
Immigration	Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President.
Immigration	The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration.
Immigration	It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course.
Immigration	So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?
Immigration	Because we made a mistake.
Immigration	It took too long to get it right.
Immigration	Too long to get it right.
Immigration	I'll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States.
Immigration	And the fact is, and I’ve made it very clear, within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people.
Immigration	And all those so called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be legally certified again, to be able to stay in this country, and put on a path to citizenship.
Immigration	The idea that they are being sent home by this guy, and they want to do, that is they go to a country they've never seen before.
Immigration	I can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it’s and it's illegal.
Immigration	You say ‘Oh, no, Mom, leave me here.
Immigration	I'm not gonna go with you.’ They’ve been here.
Immigration	Many of them are model citizens.
Immigration	20,000 are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis.
Immigration	We owe them.
Immigration	We owe them.
Immigration	President Trump, your response.
Immigration	He had eight years to do what he said he was going to do.
Immigration	And I've changed without having a specific -- we get rid of catch and release, got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with.
Immigration	But he had eight years he was vice president.
Immigration	He did nothing except build cages to keep children in.
Immigration	Vice President, what’s your response?
Immigration	The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there?
Immigration	If in fact, you had family, came across, they're arrested.
Immigration	They, in fact, were given a date to show up for their hearing.
Immigration	They were released.
Immigration	And guess what, they showed up for the hearing.
Immigration	This is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country.
Immigration	That's never happened before.
Immigration	That’s never happened before in our country.
Immigration	You come to the United States and you make your case.
Immigration	That’s how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law.
Immigration	They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.
Immigration	President Trump, there is --
Immigration	It’s so important.
Immigration	It shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws.
Immigration	Catch and release is a disaster.
Immigration	A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in -- we would take their name, we have to release them into our country.
Immigration	And then you say they come back.
Immigration	Less than 1% of the people come back.
Immigration	Not true.
Immigration	We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them.
Immigration	We would say, ‘Come back in two years, three years -- we're going to give you a court case.
Immigration	You did Perry Mason, we're going to give you a court case.
Immigration	When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe.
Immigration	They never come back.
Immigration	Only the really --  I hate to say this -- but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back.
Immigration	OK, President Trump, let’s give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we're going to move on to the next section.
Immigration	You don’t know the law, Joe.
Immigration	Vice President Biden, your response.
Immigration	I know the law.
Immigration	What he's telling you is simply not true.
Immigration	They don’t come back.
Immigration	Check it out.
Immigration	All right, let's move on --
Immigration	But we don’t have to worry about it because I terminated it.
Immigration	So we don’t have to worry about it
Immigration	All right, let’s move on to the next section --
Immigration	You have 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents.
Immigration	Go ahead.
	
Race in America	Yes, I do.
Race in America	And again, he's been in government 47 years.
Race in America	He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community.
Race in America	And they were called, and he called them, super predators.
Race in America	And he said that, he said it -- super predators.
Race in America	And they can never live that down.
Race in America	1994, your crime bill, the super predators.
Race in America	Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump.
Race in America	And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done.
Race in America	Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it.
Race in America	I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it.
Race in America	They might have wanted to do it.
Race in America	But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture.
Race in America	And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the Oval Office.
Race in America	Two weeks later, they're out saying, ‘Gee, we have to defeat him.’ Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina.
Race in America	He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones.
Race in America	It’s one of the most successful programs.
Race in America	People don't talk about it.
Race in America	Tremendous investment is being made.
Race in America	Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities.
Race in America	After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office.
Race in America	And they said-- I said, ‘What are you doing after three years?’ I said, ‘Why do you keep coming back?’ ‘Because we have no funding’.
Race in America	I said, ‘You don't have to come back every year’, ‘We have to come back’, because President Obama would never give them long term funding.
Race in America	And I did.
Race in America	Ten-year, long term funding, and I give them more money than they asked for, because I said, ‘I think you need more’.
Race in America	And I said, ‘The only bad part about this is I may never see you again’, because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them.
Race in America	But I saved colleges and universities.
Race in America	OK.
Race in America	And we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President?
Race in America	My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying.
Race in America	The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, ‘The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail.
Race in America	There's not enough people in jail,’ and go on my website, get the quote the date when he said it, ‘not enough people’.
Race in America	He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to mauraud our cities.
Race in America	This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty.
Race in America	None of them were-- none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested.
Race in America	Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people-- he committed 20 people’s sentences.
Race in America	We committed over 1,000 people’s sentences.
Race in America	Over 1,000.
Race in America	The very law he's talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama.
Race in America	And secondly, we're in a situation here where we-- the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration.
Race in America	And one of the things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law.
Race in America	That's why I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts.
Race in America	Nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem.
Race in America	They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail.
Race in America	We should fundamentally change the system and that's what I'm going to do.
Race in America	But why didn't he do it four years ago?
Race in America	Why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that?
Race in America	Why didn't you--
Race in America	I am not--
Race in America	You were vice president.
Race in America	You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this.
Race in America	But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.
Race in America	We did--
Race in America	You know, Joe, I ran because of you.
Race in America	I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job.
Race in America	If I said you did a good job, I would have never run.
Race in America	I would've never run.
Race in America	I ran because of you.
Race in America	I'm looking at you now, you're a politician.
Race in America	I ran because of you.
Race in America	All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that?
Race in America	And then I do have some questions for both of you.
Race in America	Well, I’ll tell you what, I hope he does look at me because what's happening here is you know who I am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth.
Race in America	I am anxious to have this race.
Race in America	I'm anxious to see this take place.
Race in America	I am-- the character of the country is on the ballot.
Race in America	Our character is on the ballot.
Race in America	Look at us closely.
Race in America	Let me ask them some follow--
Race in America	Excuse me--
Race in America	Please respond and then we’re gonna have follow up questions.
Race in America	If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, a wreck-- If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician.
Race in America	So don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby.
Race in America	Joe, they're calling you a corrupt politician--
Race in America	Nobody says--
Race in America	President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race.
Race in America	We're talking about the issue--
Race in America	It’s the laptop from hell.
Race in America	The laptop from hell.
Race in America	President Trump, we’re talking about race right now and I do want to speak on the issue of race.
Race in America	President Trump---
Race in America	Nobody-- Kristen, I have to respond to that.
Race in America	Please, very quickly.
Race in America	Look, there are 50 former National Intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a Russian plan.
Race in America	They have said that this has all the characteristics-- four-- five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage.
Race in America	Nobody believes it except him, his,  and his good friend Rudy Giuliani.
Race in America	You mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax?
Race in America	You gotta be--
Race in America	That’s exactly what-- That’s exactly what--
Race in America	Is this where you’re going?
Race in America	This is where he’s going.
Race in America	The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?
Race in America	Gentleman, I want to stay on the issue of race, okay--
Race in America	You have to be kidding here.
Race in America	Here we go again with Russia.
Race in America	Mr. President, we're gonna continue on the issue of race.
Race in America	Mr. President, you've described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate.
Race in America	You've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters.
Race in America	You've said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired.
Race in America	What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?
Race in America	Well you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting ‘Pigs in a blanket’, talking about police, ‘Pigs, Pigs’, talking about our police, ‘Pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon’.
Race in America	I said, ‘That's a horrible thing’.
Race in America	And they were marching down the street.
Race in America	And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter.
Race in America	I thought it was a terrible thing.
Race in America	As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people.
Race in America	I am the least racist person in this room.
Race in America	What do you say to men who are concerned by that rhetoric?
Race in America	I don't, I don't know what to say.
Race in America	I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones.
Race in America	I took care of Black colleges and universities.
Race in America	I don't know what to say.
Race in America	They can say anything.
Race in America	I mean, they can say anything.
Race in America	It's a very-- it makes me sad because I am the least racist person.
Race in America	I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience.
Race in America	I’m the least racist person in this room.
Race in America	OK.
Race in America	Vice President Biden, let me ask you, very quickly, and then I have a follow up question for you.
Race in America	Abraham Lincoln.
Race in America	Here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history.
Race in America	He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one.
Race in America	He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists.
Race in America	He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims.
Race in America	He has moved around and made everything worse across the board.
Race in America	He says to them about the ‘Poor Boys’, last time we were on stage here.
Race in America	He said, ‘I told him to stand down and stand ready’.
Race in America	Come on.
Race in America	This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn.
Race in America	President Trump, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then have a follow up question.
Race in America	He made a reference to Abraham Lincoln.
Race in America	Where did that come in?
Race in America	I mean--
Race in America	You said you were Abraham Lincoln.
Race in America	No, no.
Race in America	I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community.
Race in America	I didn’t say  ‘I'm Abraham Lincoln’.
Race in America	I said, ‘Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the Black community’.
Race in America	Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put--
Race in America	Oh, God.
Race in America	Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail.
Race in America	And you know what?
Race in America	They remember it because it you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly.
Race in America	Just take a look at what’s happening out there.
Race in America	All right, let me-- Let me ask Vice President Biden about-- Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context.
Race in America	Crime bill that you supported in the 80s and 90s  contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession.
Race in America	They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they’re uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences.
Race in America	So speak to those families, why should they vote for you?
Race in America	One of the things that is said, in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs.
Race in America	It was a mistake.
Race in America	I've been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine.
Race in America	That's why I've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense.
Race in America	They should be going into treatment across the board.
Race in America	That's what we should be spending money on.
Race in America	That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends.
Race in America	They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem.
Race in America	They should be going into treatment.
Race in America	Treatment.
Race in America	That's what we've been trying to do.
Race in America	That's what I'm going to get done because they may-- the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug.
Race in America	But they were not in the crime bill.
Race in America	But why didn't he get it done?
Race in America	See, it's all talk no action with these politicians.
Race in America	Why didn't he get it?
Race in America	‘That's what I'm gonna do when I become president’.
Race in America	You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years.
Race in America	Why didn't you get it done?
Race in America	 You had eight years to get it done?
Race in America	Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe.
Race in America	We got a lot of it done.
Race in America	We released 38,000-- We got 38,000 prisoners left from--
Race in America	You got nothing done
Race in America	38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison.
Race in America	We have-- there were over 1000 people who were given clemency.
Race in America	We-- in fact, we’re the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern of practice of the police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves.
Race in America	I could go on, but we began the process.
Race in America	We began the process.
Race in America	We lost an election.
Race in America	That's why I'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy.
Race in America	I just ask-- I just ask one question: why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago?
Race in America	Why didn't you do it?
Race in America	You just said, ‘I'm going to do that.
Race in America	I'm going to do this.’ You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison.
Race in America	Now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that.
Race in America	Why didn't you get it done?
Race in America	You had eight years with Obama?
Race in America	You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action.
Race in America	All right, Vice President Biden and then we're gonna move on to the next section.
Race in America	We had a Republican Congress.
Race in America	That’s the answer.
Race in America	OK.
Race in America	Well, you gotta talk-- you gotta talk 'em into it, Joe.
Race in America	Sometimes you gotta talk ‘em into it.
Race in America	All right, we’re gonna move on to our next section which is climate change-
Race in America	Like I did with criminal justice reform.
Race in America	I had to talk Democrats into it.
	
Climate Change	And we haven't destroyed our industries.
Climate Change	Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted.
Climate Change	President Trump, your response --
Climate Change	They came out and said very strongly, ‘$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan’, that his plan is an economic disaster.
Climate Change	If you look at what he wants to do, you know if you look at his plan, you know, you know who developed it?
Climate Change	AOC+3.
Climate Change	They know nothing about the climate.
Climate Change	I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate.
Climate Change	And they're all hopping through hoops for AOC+3.
Climate Change	Look, they’re real play costs $100 trillion.
Climate Change	If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that.
Climate Change	When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows.
Climate Change	As far as they're concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing.
Climate Change	This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen.
Climate Change	And this wasn't done by smart people.
Climate Change	This wasn't done by anybody.
Climate Change	Frankly, I don't even know how it can be good politically.
Climate Change	They want to spend $100 trillion.
Climate Change	That's their real number.
Climate Change	He's trying to say it was six.
Climate Change	It’s $100 trillion.
Climate Change	They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things.
Climate Change	And many other things--
Climate Change	All right-- Okay, let me have the vice president respond and we're running out of time and we have a lot more questions.
Climate Change	So let's hear from the Vice President.
Climate Change	I have a number of more questions.
Climate Change	I don't know where he comes from.
Climate Change	I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers.
Climate Change	$100 trillion?
Climate Change	Give me a break.
Climate Change	This plan was-- This plan has been endorsed by every major-- every major environmental group and every labor group.
Climate Change	Labor.
Climate Change	Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breath.
Climate Change	And they know they're good jobs in getting us there.
Climate Change	And by the way, the fastest growing industry in America are--is, is, is the electric--excuse me, solar energy and wind.
Climate Change	He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills.
Climate Change	It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45-50 bucks an hour.
Climate Change	We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I’m proposing.
Climate Change	President Trump-- Please respond and then I have a follow up.
Climate Change	Excuse me.
Climate Change	We are energy independent for the first time.
Climate Change	We don't need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy.
Climate Change	We are energy independent.
Climate Change	I know more about wind than you do.
Climate Change	It’s extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it’s very intermittent.
Climate Change	It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China.
Climate Change	And the fumes coming up-- If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean.
Climate Change	One other thing--
Climate Change	Find me a scientist that says that.
Climate Change	Solar.
Climate Change	I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet.
Climate Change	It's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world--
Climate Change	False.
Climate Change	So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do?
Climate Change	We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world.
Climate Change	But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry.
Climate Change	You want-- And what about fracking?
Climate Change	All right.
Climate Change	Let me allow Vice President Biden to respond--
Climate Change	I have never said I oppose fracking.
Climate Change	You said it on tape.
Climate Change	I did?
Climate Change	Show the tape.
Climate Change	Put it on your website.
Climate Change	I’ll put it on.
Climate Change	Put it on the website.
Climate Change	The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying.
Climate Change	Would you rule out banning fracking?
Climate Change	I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need-- We need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately,  a complete zero emissions by 2025.
Climate Change	What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking.
Climate Change	Capture the emissions from gas.
Climate Change	We can do that and we can do that by investing money into-- It's a transition to that.
Climate Change	I have one more question--
Climate Change	Excuse me.
Climate Change	He was against fracking.
Climate Change	He said it.
Climate Change	 I will show that to you tomorrow.
Climate Change	‘I am against fracking’, until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said-- You know what, Pennsylvania?
Climate Change	He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.
Climate Change	Fracking on federal Land, I said.
Climate Change	No fracking or oil on federal land--
Climate Change	Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section.
Climate Change	President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants.
Climate Change	In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick.
Climate Change	Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities.
Climate Change	Why should these families give you another four years in office?
Climate Change	Vice President Biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you.
Climate Change	My response is that those people live on what they call ‘Fence Lines’.
Climate Change	He doesn't understand this.
Climate Change	They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute.
Climate Change	 Chemical plants, and oil plants and refineries that pollute.
Climate Change	I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claremont, Delaware.
Climate Change	And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is anyplace, including in Houston at the time.
Climate Change	When my mom would get the car when they're first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there’d be oil slick in the window.
Climate Change	That's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer.
Climate Change	The fact is those frontline communities, it doesn't matter what you're paying them.
Climate Change	It matters how you keep them safe.
Climate Change	What do you do?
Climate Change	And you impose restrictions on the pollution, that the pollutants coming out of those fenceline communities.
Climate Change	OK, I have one final question--
Climate Change	Would you close down the-- Would you close down the oil industry?
Climate Change	I would transition from the oil industry.
Climate Change	Yes.
Climate Change	Oh, transition.
Climate Change	It is a big statement because I would stop--
Climate Change	Why would you do that?
Climate Change	Because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal —
Climate Change	That’s a big statement.
Climate Change	Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time.
Climate Change	Over time.
Climate Change	And I’d stop giving to the oil industry-- I’d stop giving them federal subsidies.
Climate Change	You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind.
Climate Change	 Why are we giving it to the oil industry?
Climate Change	We actually do give it to solar and wind--
Climate Change	All right, we have one final question--
Climate Change	That’s the biggest statement.
Climate Change	In terms of business.
Climate Change	that's the biggest statement.
Climate Change	All right, we have one final question-- Mr. President--
Climate Change	Because basically what he’s saying is he’s going to destroy the oil industry.
Climate Change	Will you remember that Texas?
Climate Change	Will you remember that Pennsylvania?
Climate Change	Oklahoma?
Climate Change	Ohio?
Climate Change	Vice President Biden, let me give you ten seconds to respond and then I have to get to the final question.
Climate Change	Vice President Biden?
Climate Change	He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions.
Climate Change	The first place to do that by the year 2025 is in energy production.
Climate Change	By 2050, totally.
Climate Change	All right.
Climate Change	One final question--
Climate Change	Is he gonna get China to do it?
Climate Change	Is he going to get China to do it?
Climate Change	No, we're finished with this.
Climate Change	We have to move on to our final question.
Climate Change	No, I’m going to rejoin the Paris Accord and get China to abide by what they agreed to
Climate Change	But that’ll cost you $1 trillion.
