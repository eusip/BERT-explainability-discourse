1	President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments.
1	You talked about taking a therapeutic.
1	I assume you're referencing Regeneron.
1	You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks.
1	Is that a guarantee?
1	It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance.
1	One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.
1	Can you tell us what companies?
1	Johnson and Johnson is doing very well.
1	Moderna is doing very well.
1	Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others.
1	And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.
1	Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now.
1	Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022.
1	Is your timeline realistic?
1	No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate.
1	I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics.
1	And this is a very easy distribution for him.
1	He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.
1	Vice President Biden, your reaction?
1	Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government.
1	What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?
1	Make sure it's totally transparent.
1	Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes.
1	And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time.
1	This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer.
1	We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.
1	President Trump, your reaction?
1	He says you have no plan.
1	I don’t think it’s going to be a dark winter at all.
1	We're opening up our country.
1	We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning.
1	When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon.
1	Now he's saying, ‘Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.’ But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me.
1	And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster.
1	Far less lethal.
1	But it was a total disaster.
1	Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease.
1	Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said ‘It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.’ Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this.
1	Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.
1	Vice President Biden, your response?
1	My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China.
1	And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that.
1	In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was.
1	What did the President say in January?
1	He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent.
1	We owe him a debt of gratitude.
1	We have to thank him.
1	And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people.
1	And again, I go back to this, he had nothing.
1	He did virtually nothing.
1	And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, ‘Oh, don't worry.
1	This is all going to be over soon.’ Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon.
1	President Trump, your reaction?
1	I did not say over soon.
1	I say we're learning to live with it.
1	We have no choice.
1	We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does.
1	He has the ability to lock himself up.
1	I don’t know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement.
1	People can’t do that.
1	By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that.
1	I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears.
1	I can't do that.
1	And here’s — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything.
1	I said, you know, this is dangerous.
1	And you catch it.
1	And you know, I caught it.
1	I learned a lot.
1	I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals.
1	And now, I recovered.
1	99.9 of young people recover.
1	99% of people recover.
1	We have to recover.
1	We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation.
1	And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it.
1	Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though.
1	Can I respond to that?
1	30 seconds please, and then I have a question.
1	Number one.
1	He says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it.
1	People are learning to die with it.
1	You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning.
1	That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone.
1	Learning to live with it?
1	Come on.
1	We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous.
1	When's the last time?
1	Is it really dangerous, still?
1	Are we dangerous?
1	Tell the people, is it dangerous now?
1	What should they do about the danger?
1	And you say, I take no responsibility.
1	Let me talk about —
1	Excuse me.
1	Very quickly.
1	I take full responsibility.
1	It's not my fault that it came here.
1	It's China's fault.
1	You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either.
1	It's China's fault.
1	They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves
1	Vice President Biden.
1	as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit.
1	The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — What happened?
1	What did the President say?
1	He said don't worry, it's going to go away, it’s going to be gone by Easter.
1	Don't worry, the warm weather.
1	Don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious.
1	A whole range of things the President said.
1	And even today, he thinks we are in control.
1	We're about to lose 200,000 more people
1	President Trump.
1	Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this.
1	When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed.
1	And that went on for months.
1	What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing.
1	She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco.
1	But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing.
1	You’re xenophobic.
1	I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China.
1	Now he says I should have closed it earlier.
1	It just Joe, it doesn't —
1	I didn't say either of those things.
1	You certainly did.
1	I talked about his xenophobia in a different context.
1	It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.
1	All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this.
1	He thought I shouldn't have closed the border.
0	Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it’s easy to use them to get into our country.
0	We now have a stronger border as we've ever had.
0	We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally.
0	I do.
0	I do.
0	You know, my daughter is a social worker.
0	And she's written a lot about this.
0	She's got a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work.
0	So, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on.
0	When I didn't -- I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel.
0	And don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you.
0	But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just Yes or No sir, just hands on top of the wheel.
0	Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps.
0	The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America.
0	And we have always said we've never lived up to it.
0	Do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal?
0	Guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it.
0	We have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion.
0	This is the first president come along and says that's the end of that.
0	We're not going to do that anymore.
0	We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses.
0	All the things we can do.
0	And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things.
0	Just to give people a shot.
0	It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.
0	So we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs.
0	I do love the environment, but what I want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air.
0	We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time.
0	Not Joe.
0	I haven't heard him use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it.
0	And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years.
0	Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can’t do-- Look at China, how filthy it is.
0	Look at Russia.
0	Look at India.
0	It's filthy.
0	The air is filthy.
0	The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly.
0	When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice.
0	They were going to take away our businesses.
0	I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord.
0	It was so unfair.
0	China doesn't kick in until 2030.
0	Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away.
0	It would-- It would have been-- It would have destroyed our businesses.
0	So, you ready?
0	We have done an incredible job environmentally.
0	We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.
0	Climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity.
0	We have a moral obligation to deal with it.
0	And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don't have much time.
0	We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years.
0	Four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up-- to limit the-- limit of admissions will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble.
0	Here's where we have a great opportunity, I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan.
0	Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs.
0	We're going to invest in, for example, 500,000-- 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future.
0	In the meantime, China's doing that.
0	We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs.
0	And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment.
0	Our health and our jobs are at stake.
0	That's what's happening.
0	And we-- right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan-- My plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his.
0	This from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy.
0	The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made.
0	If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nice times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely.
0	Nine times more.
0	Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money.
0	Economically, we saved it.
0	And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic.
0	We saved it.
0	We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back.
0	We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline.
0	Remember that.
0	We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China.
0	Now we're rebuilding it and we're doing record numbers,  11.4 million jobs in a short period of time etc..
0	But, I will tell you, go back before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me.
0	They wanted to get together.
0	We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country, Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas MIT graduates, number one in the class-- everybody had the best numbers.
0	And you know what?
0	The other side wanted to get together.
0	They wanted to unify.
0	Success is going to bring us together.
0	We are on the road to success.
0	But I’m cutting taxes and he wants to raise everybody’s taxes.
0	And he wants to put new regulations on everything.
0	He will kill it.
0	If he gets in, you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen.
0	Your 401K's will go to hell and it'll be a very, very sad day for this country.
0	We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China.
0	Now we're rebuilding it and we're doing record numbers,  11.4 million jobs in a short period of time etc..
0	I will say, ‘I’m the American president.
0	I represent all of you whether you voted for me or against me.
0	And I'm going to make sure that you’re represented.
0	I’m going to give you hope.
0	We're going to move.
0	We're going to choose science over fiction.
0	We're going to choose hope over fear.
0	We're going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make things better.
0	We can grow this economy.
0	We can deal with a systemic racism.
0	At the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run, and moved, and motivated by clean energy, creating millions of new jobs.
0	And that's the fact, that's what we're going to do.
0	And I'm going to say, as I said at the beginning, what is on the ballot here is the character of this country.
0	Decency.
0	Honor.
0	Respect.
0	Treating people with dignity.
0	Making sure that everyone has an even chance.
0	Now, I'm going to make sure you get that.
0	You haven't been getting it the last four years.
0	I will say, ‘I’m the American president.
0	I represent all of you whether you voted for me or against me.
0	And I'm going to make sure that you’re represented.
0	I’m going to give you hope.

0	And that's the fact, that's what we're going to do.
0	And I'm going to say, as I said at the beginning, what is on the ballot here is the character of this country.
0	Decency.
0	Honor.
0	Respect.
0	Treating people with dignity.
0	Making sure that everyone has an even chance.
0	Now, I'm going to make sure you get that.
0	You haven't been getting it the last four years.
