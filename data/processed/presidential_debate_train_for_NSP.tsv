So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die.
We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China.
It's a worldwide pandemic.
It’s all over the world.
You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now.
If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%.
The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country.
And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard.
There is a spike.
There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone.
There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone.
There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone.
And there were some spikes and surges in other places.
They will soon be gone.
We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready.
It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered.
We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine.
I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it.
And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it.
Some people could say it was a cure.
But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight.
And now they say I'm immune.
Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune.
More and more people are getting better.
We have a problem that's a worldwide problem.
This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators.
We're now making ventilators.
All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away.
220,000 Americans dead.
If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this.
Anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America.
We're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day.
And there are over 70,000 new cases per day.
Compared to what's going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate.
We're starting from a very high rate.
The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year.
If we just wore these masks — the President's own advisors told them — we could save 100,000 lives.
And we're in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan.
No comprehensive plan.
What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time.
I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing.
I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that.
We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic.
And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.
Take a look what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying.
And I don't look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states.
They’re all the United States.
And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus.
They’re the red states.
They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that's where the spike is occurring significantly, but they're all Americans.
They're all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need.
The money's already been passed to do that.
It's been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing's happened.
	
I made it clear.
And I asked everyone else to take the pledge.
I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price.
They will pay the price.
It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved.
China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved.
They will pay a price if I'm elected.
Interfering with American sovereignty.
That's what's going on right now.
They're interfering with American sovereignty.
And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President said anything to Putin about it.
I don't think he's talking a lot.
I don't think he said a word.
I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it.
And I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians.
My guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians.
But the point is this, folks.
We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election.
His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won't, I shouldn't — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani.
He's being used as a Russian pawn.
He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true.
And then what happens?
Nothing happens.
And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me.
I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO.
I don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question.
Why isn't that being done?
Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty.
What I’d make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done.
He has caused the deficit in China to go up not down — with China, go up not down.
We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property.
You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%.
We would not do that at all, number one.
Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well.
When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said ‘we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you can't fly through them.’ I said, ‘we're gonna fly through them.
We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it.
We're not going to pay attention.’ They have to play by the rules, and what's he do?
He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies.
We make up only — we’ re 25%.
25% of the world's economy.
We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules.
You play by them or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them, economically.
That's the way I will run it.
And that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president.
When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour.
He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea.
He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea.
Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability.
In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me.
We have a different kind of relationship.
We have a very good relationship, and there's no war.
And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area.
They said, ‘oh there's going to be trouble.’ I said, ‘No, they're not.
Because he's not going to do that.’ And I was right.
Look, instead of being in a war where millions of people — Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul — millions of people would be dead right now.
We don’t have a war, and I have a good relationship.
When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour.
He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea.
He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea.
Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability.
In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me.
	
First of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible.
Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate.
That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it.
The individual mandate -- we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance.
I terminate it; it's gone.
Now it's in court, because Obamacare is no good.
But then I made a decision, ‘Run it as well as you can’ --  to my people, great people -- ‘Run it as well as you can.’ I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy.
They ran it.
Premiums are down, everything's down.
Here's the problem.
No matter how well you run it, it's no good.
What we'd like to do is terminate it.
We have the individual mandate done.
I don't know that it's going to work.
If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it will be better run.
But it no longer is Obamacare.
Because without the individual mandate, it is much different.
Pre-existing conditions will always stay.
What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better.
We’ll always protect people with pre existing -- so I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care.
The Democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them.
And we might even have the House at that time.
And I think we're going to win the House, okay?
You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House.
But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions -- and one thing very important.
We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare.
Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies.
These are people that love the health care, people that have been successful -- middle income people -- been successful.
They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine.
He won't even have a choice.
They want to terminate 180 million plans.
We have done an incredible job with health care.
And we're going to do even better.
What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option -- become Bidencare.
Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be -- if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies.
That's what's going to happen.
Secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition that doesn't exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies.
Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance -- the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance.
That's why I did not -- not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare.
They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else.
Lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we've actually protect pre existing -- there's no way he can protect pre existing conditions.
None, zero, you can't do it in the ether.
He's been talking about this for a long time.
There is no -- he's never come up with a plan.
I guess we're gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20.
The fact that -- I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you're getting anxious -- the fact is that he’s already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover.
10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre existing conditions.
And all the people from COVID are going to have pre existing conditions.
What are they going to do?
The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states.
It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities.
It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally.
We were going to take care of everything for them.
And what that does, and I'd love to do that,  I'd love to help them.
But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country.
We can't do it.
This was a way of taking care of them.
This was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with COVID, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.

Let me just say.
They built cages.
You know, they used to say I built the cages.
And then they had a picture in the newspaper.
There was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, ‘Look at these cages, President Trump built them.’ And then it was determined they were built in 2014.
That was him.
Do you have a plan to reunite the kids?
Yes, we're working on a very -- we're trying very hard.
But a lot of these kids come up without the parents, they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs.
Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation.
Quick response and then another question to you.
These 500 plus kids came with parents.
They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with.
Big real tough, really strong.
And guess what?
They cannot -- it’s not coyotes that bring them over, their parents were with them.
They got separated from their parents.
And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every judge of who we are as a nation.
Let me ask you a follow up --
Kristen, they did it, we changed the policy.
They did it.
We changed it.
They set up the cages.
They -- who built the cages?
So let's talk about --
Who built the cages, Joe?
Let’s talk about what we’re talking about.
What happened?
Parents were ripped -- their kids were ripped from their arms and separated.
And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone.
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go.
It's criminal.
It's criminal.
Let me just --
Let me say this.
They worked it out, we brought reporters and everything.
They are so well taken care of.
They're in facilities that were so clean --
But some of them haven’t been reunited --
But just answer one question.
Who built the cages?
A big ask of that, who built the cages?
Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President.
The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration.
It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course.
So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?
Because we made a mistake.
It took too long to get it right.
Too long to get it right.
I'll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States.
And the fact is, and I’ve made it very clear, within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people.
And all those so called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be legally certified again, to be able to stay in this country, and put on a path to citizenship.
The idea that they are being sent home by this guy, and they want to do, that is they go to a country they've never seen before.
I can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it’s and it's illegal.
You say ‘Oh, no, Mom, leave me here.
I'm not gonna go with you.’ They’ve been here.
Many of them are model citizens.
20,000 are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis.
We owe them.
We owe them.
President Trump, your response.
He had eight years to do what he said he was going to do.
And I've changed without having a specific -- we get rid of catch and release, got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with.
But he had eight years he was vice president.
He did nothing except build cages to keep children in.
Vice President, what’s your response?
The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there?
If in fact, you had family, came across, they're arrested.
They, in fact, were given a date to show up for their hearing.
They were released.
And guess what, they showed up for the hearing.
This is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country.
That's never happened before.
That’s never happened before in our country.
You come to the United States and you make your case.
That’s how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law.
They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.
President Trump, there is --
It’s so important.
It shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws.
Catch and release is a disaster.
A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in -- we would take their name, we have to release them into our country.
And then you say they come back.
Less than 1% of the people come back.
Not true.
We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them.
We would say, ‘Come back in two years, three years -- we're going to give you a court case.
You did Perry Mason, we're going to give you a court case.
When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe.
They never come back.
Only the really --  I hate to say this -- but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back.
OK, President Trump, let’s give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we're going to move on to the next section.
You don’t know the law, Joe.
Vice President Biden, your response.
I know the law.
What he's telling you is simply not true.
They don’t come back.
Check it out.
All right, let's move on --
But we don’t have to worry about it because I terminated it.
So we don’t have to worry about it
All right, let’s move on to the next section --
You have 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents.
Go ahead.
	
Yes, I do.
And again, he's been in government 47 years.
He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community.
And they were called, and he called them, super predators.
And he said that, he said it -- super predators.
And they can never live that down.
1994, your crime bill, the super predators.
Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump.
And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done.
Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it.
I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it.
They might have wanted to do it.
But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture.
And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the Oval Office.
Two weeks later, they're out saying, ‘Gee, we have to defeat him.’ Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina.
He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones.
It’s one of the most successful programs.
People don't talk about it.
Tremendous investment is being made.
Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities.
After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office.
And they said-- I said, ‘What are you doing after three years?’ I said, ‘Why do you keep coming back?’ ‘Because we have no funding’.
I said, ‘You don't have to come back every year’, ‘We have to come back’, because President Obama would never give them long term funding.
And I did.
Ten-year, long term funding, and I give them more money than they asked for, because I said, ‘I think you need more’.
And I said, ‘The only bad part about this is I may never see you again’, because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them.
But I saved colleges and universities.
OK.
And we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President?
My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying.
The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, ‘The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail.
There's not enough people in jail,’ and go on my website, get the quote the date when he said it, ‘not enough people’.
He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to mauraud our cities.
This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty.
None of them were-- none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested.
Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people-- he committed 20 people’s sentences.
We committed over 1,000 people’s sentences.
Over 1,000.
The very law he's talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama.
And secondly, we're in a situation here where we-- the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration.
And one of the things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law.
That's why I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts.
Nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem.
They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail.
We should fundamentally change the system and that's what I'm going to do.
But why didn't he do it four years ago?
Why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that?
Why didn't you--
I am not--
You were vice president.
You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this.
But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.
We did--
You know, Joe, I ran because of you.
I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job.
If I said you did a good job, I would have never run.
I would've never run.
I ran because of you.
I'm looking at you now, you're a politician.
I ran because of you.
All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that?
And then I do have some questions for both of you.
Well, I’ll tell you what, I hope he does look at me because what's happening here is you know who I am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth.
I am anxious to have this race.
I'm anxious to see this take place.
I am-- the character of the country is on the ballot.
Our character is on the ballot.
Look at us closely.
Let me ask them some follow--
Excuse me--
Please respond and then we’re gonna have follow up questions.
If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, a wreck-- If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician.
So don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby.
Joe, they're calling you a corrupt politician--
Nobody says--
President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race.
We're talking about the issue--
It’s the laptop from hell.
The laptop from hell.
President Trump, we’re talking about race right now and I do want to speak on the issue of race.
President Trump---
Nobody-- Kristen, I have to respond to that.
Please, very quickly.
Look, there are 50 former National Intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a Russian plan.
They have said that this has all the characteristics-- four-- five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage.
Nobody believes it except him, his,  and his good friend Rudy Giuliani.
You mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax?
You gotta be--
That’s exactly what-- That’s exactly what--
Is this where you’re going?
This is where he’s going.
The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?
Gentleman, I want to stay on the issue of race, okay--
You have to be kidding here.
Here we go again with Russia.
Mr. President, we're gonna continue on the issue of race.
Mr. President, you've described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate.
You've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters.
You've said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired.
What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?
Well you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting ‘Pigs in a blanket’, talking about police, ‘Pigs, Pigs’, talking about our police, ‘Pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon’.
I said, ‘That's a horrible thing’.
And they were marching down the street.
And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter.
I thought it was a terrible thing.
As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people.
I am the least racist person in this room.
What do you say to men who are concerned by that rhetoric?
I don't, I don't know what to say.
I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones.
I took care of Black colleges and universities.
I don't know what to say.
They can say anything.
I mean, they can say anything.
It's a very-- it makes me sad because I am the least racist person.
I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience.
I’m the least racist person in this room.
OK.
Vice President Biden, let me ask you, very quickly, and then I have a follow up question for you.
Abraham Lincoln.
Here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history.
He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one.
He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists.
He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims.
He has moved around and made everything worse across the board.
He says to them about the ‘Poor Boys’, last time we were on stage here.
He said, ‘I told him to stand down and stand ready’.
Come on.
This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn.
President Trump, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then have a follow up question.
He made a reference to Abraham Lincoln.
Where did that come in?
I mean--
You said you were Abraham Lincoln.
No, no.
I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community.
I didn’t say  ‘I'm Abraham Lincoln’.
I said, ‘Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the Black community’.
Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put--
Oh, God.
Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail.
And you know what?
They remember it because it you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly.
Just take a look at what’s happening out there.
All right, let me-- Let me ask Vice President Biden about-- Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context.
Crime bill that you supported in the 80s and 90s  contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession.
They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they’re uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences.
So speak to those families, why should they vote for you?
One of the things that is said, in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs.
It was a mistake.
I've been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine.
That's why I've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense.
They should be going into treatment across the board.
That's what we should be spending money on.
That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends.
They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem.
They should be going into treatment.
Treatment.
That's what we've been trying to do.
That's what I'm going to get done because they may-- the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug.
But they were not in the crime bill.
But why didn't he get it done?
See, it's all talk no action with these politicians.
Why didn't he get it?
‘That's what I'm gonna do when I become president’.
You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years.
Why didn't you get it done?
You had eight years to get it done?
Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe.
We got a lot of it done.
We released 38,000-- We got 38,000 prisoners left from--
You got nothing done
38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison.
We have-- there were over 1000 people who were given clemency.
We-- in fact, we’re the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern of practice of the police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves.
I could go on, but we began the process.
We began the process.
We lost an election.
That's why I'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy.
I just ask-- I just ask one question: why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago?
Why didn't you do it?
You just said, ‘I'm going to do that.
I'm going to do this.’ You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison.
Now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that.
Why didn't you get it done?
You had eight years with Obama?
You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action.
All right, Vice President Biden and then we're gonna move on to the next section.
We had a Republican Congress.
That’s the answer.
OK.
Well, you gotta talk-- you gotta talk 'em into it, Joe.
Sometimes you gotta talk ‘em into it.
All right, we’re gonna move on to our next section which is climate change-
Like I did with criminal justice reform.
I had to talk Democrats into it.
	
And we haven't destroyed our industries.
Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted.
President Trump, your response --
They came out and said very strongly, ‘$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan’, that his plan is an economic disaster.
If you look at what he wants to do, you know if you look at his plan, you know, you know who developed it?
AOC+3.
They know nothing about the climate.
I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate.
And they're all hopping through hoops for AOC+3.
Look, they’re real play costs $100 trillion.
If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that.
Climate Change	When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows.
As far as they're concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing.
This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen.
And this wasn't done by smart people.
This wasn't done by anybody.
Frankly, I don't even know how it can be good politically.
They want to spend $100 trillion.
That's their real number.
He's trying to say it was six.
It’s $100 trillion.
They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things.
And many other things--
All right-- Okay, let me have the vice president respond and we're running out of time and we have a lot more questions.
So let's hear from the Vice President.
I have a number of more questions.
I don't know where he comes from.
I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers.
$100 trillion?
Give me a break.
This plan was-- This plan has been endorsed by every major-- every major environmental group and every labor group.
Labor.
Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breath.
And they know they're good jobs in getting us there.
And by the way, the fastest growing industry in America are--is, is, is the electric--excuse me, solar energy and wind.
He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills.
It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45-50 bucks an hour.
We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I’m proposing.
President Trump-- Please respond and then I have a follow up.
Excuse me.
We are energy independent for the first time.
We don't need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy.
We are energy independent.
I know more about wind than you do.
It’s extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it’s very intermittent.
It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China.
And the fumes coming up-- If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean.
One other thing--
Find me a scientist that says that.
Solar.
I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet.
It's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world--
False.
So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do?
We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world.
But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry.
You want-- And what about fracking?
All right.
Let me allow Vice President Biden to respond--
I have never said I oppose fracking.
You said it on tape.
I did?
Show the tape.
Put it on your website.
I’ll put it on.
Put it on the website.
The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying.
Would you rule out banning fracking?
I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need-- We need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately,  a complete zero emissions by 2025.
What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking.
Capture the emissions from gas.
We can do that and we can do that by investing money into-- It's a transition to that.
I have one more question--
Excuse me.
He was against fracking.
He said it.
I will show that to you tomorrow.
‘I am against fracking’, until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said-- You know what, Pennsylvania?
He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.
Fracking on federal Land, I said.
No fracking or oil on federal land--
Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section.
President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants.
In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick.
Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities.
Why should these families give you another four years in office?
Vice President Biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you.
My response is that those people live on what they call ‘Fence Lines’.
He doesn't understand this.
They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute.
Chemical plants, and oil plants and refineries that pollute.
I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claremont, Delaware.
And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is anyplace, including in Houston at the time.
When my mom would get the car when they're first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there’d be oil slick in the window.
That's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer.
The fact is those frontline communities, it doesn't matter what you're paying them.
It matters how you keep them safe.
What do you do?
And you impose restrictions on the pollution, that the pollutants coming out of those fenceline communities.
OK, I have one final question--
Would you close down the-- Would you close down the oil industry?
I would transition from the oil industry.
Yes.
Oh, transition.
It is a big statement because I would stop--
Why would you do that?
Because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal —
That’s a big statement.
Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time.
Over time.
And I’d stop giving to the oil industry-- I’d stop giving them federal subsidies.
You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind.
 Why are we giving it to the oil industry?
We actually do give it to solar and wind--
All right, we have one final question--
That’s the biggest statement.
In terms of business.
that's the biggest statement.
All right, we have one final question-- Mr. President--
Because basically what he’s saying is he’s going to destroy the oil industry.
Will you remember that Texas?
Will you remember that Pennsylvania?
Oklahoma?
Ohio?
Vice President Biden, let me give you ten seconds to respond and then I have to get to the final question.
Vice President Biden?
He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions.
The first place to do that by the year 2025 is in energy production.
By 2050, totally.
All right.
One final question--
Is he gonna get China to do it?
Is he going to get China to do it?
No, we're finished with this.
We have to move on to our final question.
No, I’m going to rejoin the Paris Accord and get China to abide by what they agreed to
But that’ll cost you $1 trillion.
