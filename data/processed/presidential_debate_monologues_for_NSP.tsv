COVID-19	So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die.
COVID-19	We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China.
COVID-19	It's a worldwide pandemic.
COVID-19	It’s all over the world.
COVID-19	You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now.
COVID-19	If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%.
COVID-19	The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country.
COVID-19	And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard.
COVID-19	There is a spike.
COVID-19	There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone.
COVID-19	There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone.
COVID-19	There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone.
COVID-19	And there were some spikes and surges in other places.
COVID-19	They will soon be gone.
COVID-19	We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready.
COVID-19	It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered.
COVID-19	We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine.
COVID-19	I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it.
COVID-19	And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it.
COVID-19	Some people could say it was a cure.
COVID-19	But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight.
COVID-19	And now they say I'm immune.
COVID-19	Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune.
COVID-19	More and more people are getting better.
COVID-19	We have a problem that's a worldwide problem.
COVID-19	This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators.
COVID-19	We're now making ventilators.
COVID-19	All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away.
COVID-19	220,000 Americans dead.
COVID-19	If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this.
COVID-19	Anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America.
COVID-19	We're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day.
COVID-19	And there are over 70,000 new cases per day.
COVID-19	Compared to what's going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate.
COVID-19	We're starting from a very high rate.
COVID-19	The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year.
COVID-19	If we just wore these masks — the President's own advisors told them — we could save 100,000 lives.
COVID-19	And we're in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan.
COVID-19	No comprehensive plan.
COVID-19	What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time.
COVID-19	I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing.
COVID-19	I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that.
COVID-19	We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic.
COVID-19	And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.
COVID-19	Take a look what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying.
COVID-19	And I don't look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states.
COVID-19	They’re all the United States.
COVID-19	And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus.
COVID-19	They’re the red states.
COVID-19	They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that's where the spike is occurring significantly, but they're all Americans.
COVID-19	They're all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need.
COVID-19	The money's already been passed to do that.
COVID-19	It's been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing's happened.
	
National Security	I made it clear.
National Security	And I asked everyone else to take the pledge.
National Security	I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price.
National Security	They will pay the price.
National Security	It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved.
National Security	China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved.
National Security	They will pay a price if I'm elected.
National Security	Interfering with American sovereignty.
National Security	That's what's going on right now.
National Security	They're interfering with American sovereignty.
National Security	And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President said anything to Putin about it.
National Security	I don't think he's talking a lot.
National Security	I don't think he said a word.
National Security	I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it.
National Security	And I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians.
National Security	My guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians.
National Security	But the point is this, folks.
National Security	We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election.
National Security	His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won't, I shouldn't — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani.
National Security	He's being used as a Russian pawn.
National Security	He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true.
National Security	And then what happens?
National Security	Nothing happens.
National Security	And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me.
National Security	I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO.
National Security	I don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question.
National Security	Why isn't that being done?
National Security	Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty.
National Security	What I’d make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done.
National Security	He has caused the deficit in China to go up not down — with China, go up not down.
National Security	We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property.
National Security	You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%.
National Security	We would not do that at all, number one.
National Security	Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well.
National Security	When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said ‘we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you can't fly through them.’ I said, ‘we're gonna fly through them.
National Security	We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it.
National Security	We're not going to pay attention.’ They have to play by the rules, and what's he do?
National Security	He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies.
National Security	We make up only — we’ re 25%.
National Security	25% of the world's economy.
National Security	We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules.
National Security	You play by them or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them, economically.
National Security	That's the way I will run it.
National Security	And that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president.
National Security	When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour.
National Security	He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea.
National Security	He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea.
National Security	Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability.
National Security	In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me.
National Security	We have a different kind of relationship.
National Security	We have a very good relationship, and there's no war.
National Security	And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area.
National Security	They said, ‘oh there's going to be trouble.’ I said, ‘No, they're not.
National Security	Because he's not going to do that.’ And I was right.
National Security	:ook, instead of being in a war where millions of people — Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul — millions of people would be dead right now.
National Security	We don’t have a war, and I have a good relationship.
National Security	When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour.
National Security	He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea.
National Security	He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea.
National Security	Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability.
National Security	In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me.
	
Economy	First of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible.
Economy	Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate.
Economy	That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it.
Economy	The individual mandate -- we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance.
Economy	I terminate it; it's gone.
Economy	Now it's in court, because Obamacare is no good.
Economy	But then I made a decision, ‘Run it as well as you can’ --  to my people, great people -- ‘Run it as well as you can.’ I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy.
Economy	They ran it.
Economy	Premiums are down, everything's down.
Economy	Here's the problem.
Economy	No matter how well you run it, it's no good.
Economy	What we'd like to do is terminate it.
Economy	We have the individual mandate done.
Economy	I don't know that it's going to work.
Economy	If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it will be better run.
Economy	But it no longer is Obamacare.
Economy	Because without the individual mandate, it is much different.
Economy	Pre-existing conditions will always stay.
Economy	What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better.
Economy	We’ll always protect people with pre existing -- so I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care.
Economy	The Democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them.
Economy	And we might even have the House at that time.
Economy	And I think we're going to win the House, okay?
Economy	You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House.
Economy	But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions -- and one thing very important.
Economy	We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare.
Economy	Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies.
Economy	These are people that love the health care, people that have been successful -- middle income people -- been successful.
Economy	They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine.
Economy	He won't even have a choice.
Economy	They want to terminate 180 million plans.
Economy	We have done an incredible job with health care.
Economy	And we're going to do even better.
Economy	What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option -- become Bidencare.
Economy	Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be -- if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies.
Economy	That's what's going to happen.
Economy	Secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition that doesn't exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies.
Economy	Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance -- the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance.
Economy	That's why I did not -- not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare.
Economy	They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else.
Economy	Lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we've actually protect pre existing -- there's no way he can protect pre existing conditions.
Economy	None, zero, you can't do it in the ether.
Economy	He's been talking about this for a long time.
Economy	There is no -- he's never come up with a plan.
Economy	I guess we're gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20.
Economy	The fact that -- I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you're getting anxious -- the fact is that he’s already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover.
Economy	10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre existing conditions.
Economy	And all the people from COVID are going to have pre existing conditions.
Economy	What are they going to do?
Economy	The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states.
Economy	It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities.
Economy	It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally.
Economy	We were going to take care of everything for them.
Economy	And what that does, and I'd love to do that,  I'd love to help them.
Economy	But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country.
Economy	We can't do it.
Economy	This was a way of taking care of them.
Economy	This was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with COVID, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.
	
Immigration	Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it’s easy to use them to get into our country.
Immigration	We now have a stronger border as we've ever had.
Immigration	We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally.
	
Race in America	I do.
Race in America	I do.
Race in America	You know, my daughter is a social worker.
Race in America	And she's written a lot about this.
Race in America	She's got a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work.
Race in America	So, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on.
Race in America	When I didn't -- I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel.
Race in America	And don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you.
Race in America	But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just Yes or No sir, just hands on top of the wheel.
Race in America	Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps.
Race in America	The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America.
Race in America	And we have always said we've never lived up to it.
Race in America	Do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal?
Race in America	Guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it.
Race in America	We have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion.
Race in America	This is the first president come along and says that's the end of that.
Race in America	We're not going to do that anymore.
Race in America	We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses.
Race in America	All the things we can do.
Race in America	And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things.
Race in America	Just to give people a shot.
Race in America	It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.

Climate Change	So we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs.
Climate Change	I do love the environment, but what I want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air.
Climate Change	We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time.
Climate Change	Not Joe.
Climate Change	I haven't heard him use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it.
Climate Change	And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years.
Climate Change	Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can’t do-- Look at China, how filthy it is.
Climate Change	Look at Russia.
Climate Change	Look at India.
Climate Change	It's filthy.
Climate Change	The air is filthy.
Climate Change	The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly.
Climate Change	When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice.
Climate Change	They were going to take away our businesses.
Climate Change	I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord.
Climate Change	It was so unfair.
Climate Change	China doesn't kick in until 2030.
Climate Change	Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away.
Climate Change	It would-- It would have been-- It would have destroyed our businesses.
Climate Change	So, you ready?
Climate Change	We have done an incredible job environmentally.
Climate Change	We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.
Climate Change	Climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity.
Climate Change	We have a moral obligation to deal with it.
Climate Change	And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don't have much time.
Climate Change	We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years.
Climate Change	Four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up-- to limit the-- limit of admissions will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble.
Climate Change	Here's where we have a great opportunity, I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan.
Climate Change	Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs.
Climate Change	We're going to invest in, for example, 500,000-- 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future.
Climate Change	In the meantime, China's doing that.
Climate Change	We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs.
Climate Change	And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment.
Climate Change	Our health and our jobs are at stake.
Climate Change	That's what's happening.
Climate Change	And we-- right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan-- My plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his.
Climate Change	This from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy.
Climate Change	The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made.
Climate Change	If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nice times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely.
Climate Change	Nine times more.
Climate Change	Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money.
Climate Change	Economically, we saved it.
Climate Change	And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic.
Climate Change	We saved it.
Climate Change	We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back.
Climate Change	We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline.
Climate Change	Remember that.
