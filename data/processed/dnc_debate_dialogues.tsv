11	GUTHRIE	Moderator	1.0	Economy	All right. So with that business out of the way, we want to get to it. And we’ll start this evening with Senator Elizabeth Warren., Senator, good evening to you.
12	WARREN	Candidate	1.0	Economy	Thank you. Good to be here.
202	TODD	Moderator	15.0	Guns	OK, thank you, Senator Warren. You didn’t address — do you think the federal government needs to go and figure out a way to get the guns that are already out there?
203	WARREN	Candidate	15.0	Guns	What I think we need to do is we need to treat it like a serious research problem, which we have not done. You know, guns in the hands of a collector who’s had them for decades, who’s never fired them, who takes safety seriously, that’s very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly. We can’t treat this as an across-the-board problem. We have to treat it like a public health emergency. That means bring data to bear and it means make real change in this country, whether it’s politically popular or not.
204	TODD	Moderator	15.0	Guns	Thank you, Senator. Senator Booker, you have a program…
205	WARREN	Candidate	15.0	Guns	We need to fight for our children.
206	TODD	Moderator	15.0	Guns	Senator Booker, you have a federal government buyback program in your plan. How is that going to work?
207	BOOKER	Candidate	15.0	Guns	Well, first of all, I want to say, my colleague and I both have been hearing this on the campaign trail. But what’s even worse is I hear gunshots in my neighborhood. I think I’m the only one — I hope I’m the only one on this panel here that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week. Someone I knew, Shahad Smith, was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year. For millions of Americans, this is not a policy issue. This is an urgency. And for those that have not been directly affected, they’re tired of living in country where their kids go to school to learn about reading, writing, and arithmetic, and how to deal with an active shooter in their school. This is something that I’m tired of. And I’m tired of hearing people all, they have to offer is thoughts and prayers. In my faith, people say faith without works is dead. So we will find a way. But the reason we have a problem right now is we’ve let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate. It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda. I will get that done as president of the United States because this is not about policy. This is personal.
208	TODD	Moderator	15.0	Guns	Thank you, Senator Booker.
209	MADDOW	Moderator	15.0	Guns	Secretary Castro, I’d like to talk to you about something that Senator Booker just mentioned there, the idea of active shooter drills in schools, as school shootings seem like an almost everyday or every week occurrence now. They don’t make a complete news cycle anymore, no matter the death toll. As parents are so afraid as their kids go off to school that their kids will be caught up in something like this, next to nothing has changed in federal law that might affect the prevalence of school shootings. Is this a problem that is going to continue to get worse over our lifetimes? Or is there something that you would do as president that you really think would turn it around?
210	CASTRO	Candidate	15.0	Guns	You know, Rachel, I am the dad of a 10-year-old girl, Carina, who’s here tonight. And the worst thing is knowing that your child might be worried about what could happen at school, a place that’s supposed to be safe. The answer to your question is no. We don’t have to accept that. And I believe that, on January 20, 2021, at 12:01 p.m., we’re going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House, and a Democratic Senate. And the activists of Parkland, folks from Moms Demand who have risen up across the United States and inspired so many people… … you know, we may not have seen yet legislative action, but we’re getting closer. The House took a vote. In the Senate, the question often is, if the decision is between 60 votes, a filibuster, or passing commonsense gun reform, I’m going to choose commonsense gun reform. So I believe that we’re going to be able to get that done in 2021.
211	TODD	Moderator	15.0	Guns	Secretary Castro, thank you.
212	RYAN	Candidate	15.0	Guns	Rachel, I have something to add to this briefly, because…
213	MADDOW	Moderator	15.0	Guns	We’ll give you — it’ll be 30 seconds for a follow-up on that question — on that answer from Secretary Castro. Congressman Ryan?
214	RYAN	Candidate	15.0	Guns	You’re talking about in the schools. These kids are traumatized. I support all the gun reforms here. We need to start dealing with the trauma that our kids have. We need trauma-based care in every school. We need social and emotional learning in every school. Ninety percent of the shooters who do school shootings come from the school they’re in, and 73 percent of them feel shamed, traumatized, or bullied. We need to make sure that these kids feel connected to the school. That means a mental health counselor in every single school in the United States. We need to start playing offense. If our kids are so traumatized that they’re getting a gun and going into our schools, we’re doing something wrong, too, and we need reform around trauma-based care.
215	MADDOW	Moderator	15.0	Guns	Thank you, Congressman Ryan.
216	TODD	Moderator	15.0	Guns	Congressman O’Rourke, you’re a Texan who’s campaigned — you campaigned all over the state in 2018 in the most conservative parts there. What do you tell a gun owner who may agree with you on everything else, OK, but says, you know what, the Democrats, if I vote for them in there, they’re going to take my gun away, and even though I agree with you on all these other issues — how do you have that conversation?
217	O’ROURKE	Candidate	15.0	Guns	Here’s how we have that conversation in Texas. I shared with them what I learned from those students who survived the Santa Fe high school shooting, a young student named Bree. Her friend, Marcel, who survived another shooting, the mother of a victim who lost her life, Rhonda Hart, they talked about universal background checks, where you close every loophole. We know that they save lives. We talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities. Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible. They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities. Red flag laws, so if someone poses a danger to themselves or to someone else, they’re stopped before it’s too late. And what I found in each one of those 254 counties is that Democrats and independents and Republicans, gun-owners and non-gun-owners alike, agreed. But this effort must be led by the young people that you referenced at the beginning of this issue. Those students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas led the charge here in Florida, and they’ve been able to change those laws. They’re making our democracy work, ensuring that our values and our interests and our priorities are reflected in the laws that we pass.
218	TODD	Moderator	15.0	Guns	Thank you, Congressman O’Rourke. Hang on. Let me give 30 seconds, Senator Klobuchar, the iron range. I’m curious. Gun confiscation, right? If the government is buying back, how do you not have that conversation?
219	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	15.0	Guns	Well, that’s not confiscation. You could give them the offer to buy back their gun. But I’ll say this. I look at these proposals and I say, does this hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand, coming from a proud hunting and fishing state? These proposals don’t do that. When I was a prosecutor, I supported the assault weapons ban. When I was in the Senate, I saw those moms from Sandy Hook come and try to advocate for change, and we all failed. And then now these Parkland kids from Florida, they started literally a national shift. You know why? It’s just like with gay marriage. When kids talked to their parents and their grandparents, they say I don’t understand why we can’t put these sensible things in place, they listen. And if we get bested by a bunch of 17-year-olds…
220	TODD	Moderator	15.0	Guns	All right, Senator, thank you.
221	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	15.0	Guns	… it’s the best thing that ever happened. We need to get…
222	TODD	Moderator	15.0	Guns	Senator, thank you. Senator, thank you.
223	MADDOW	Moderator	15.0	Guns	Senator Booker, let me go to you on another matter actually.
224	TODD	Moderator	15.0	Guns	We’ve got to…
238	TODD	Moderator	17.0	Mitch McConnell	I’m going to get to — I’m going to get a couple of you in here. I’m going to get a couple of you in here. Thirty seconds, Congressman Delaney, you seem to believe you can do everything in a bipartisan manner. Mitch McConnell doesn’t operate that way. He operates differently. Why do you think he is going to conform to your style?
239	DELANEY	Candidate	17.0	Mitch McConnell	I think we need to get things done. That’s why I believe we need to operate in a bipartisan manner. Listen, I will sign into law bills that come to the White House that are passed on a party-line basis, absolutely. But all the big transformative things we’ve ever done in this country’s history have happened when huge majorities of the American people get behind them, which is why we need real solutions, not impossible promises. We need to put forth ideas that work, whether it’s on health care, creating universal health care so that every American gets health care, but not running on making private insurance illegal. The gun issue is related. The gun safety issue is related, because I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been with folks in Western Maryland, and they’ve said to me, you know, Democrats don’t do anything for us, Republicans don’t do anything for us. You fight all the time, so they vote on that single issue.
240	TODD	Moderator	17.0	Mitch McConnell	OK.
241	DELANEY	Candidate	17.0	Mitch McConnell	If we become the party of getting things done for the American people, with real solutions and not impossible promises, we’ll be able to get all these things done.
242	TODD	Moderator	17.0	Mitch McConnell	I promised…
243	TODD	Moderator	17.0	Mitch McConnell	Senator Booker, 30 seconds. You — how do you deal with Mitch? You’ve been in the Senate. You can’t get bills on the floor right now with Mitch McConnell. Presidents can’t do it. Is President Booker going to get his bills on the floor with Senator McConnell?
244	BOOKER	Candidate	17.0	Mitch McConnell	You know, when I got to the United States Senate, going back to what De Blasio said, as an African-American man in an African-American-dominated community, I knew one of the biggest issue was criminal justice reform, from police accountability to dealing with the fact that we have a nation that has more African-Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850. And when I got to the Senate, people told me we could not get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done. As my colleagues in the Senate know, I fought on that bill from the day I got to the Senate, built coalitions across the aisle, and today we passed the First Step Act. It’s not as far as I want to go, but thousands of people will be liberated. I have gotten — I have taken on tough problems people said we cannot achieve, and I’ve been able to get things accomplished.
245	TODD	Moderator	17.0	Mitch McConnell	Thank you, Senator Booker. Rachel has got the next question.
252	MADDOW	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	Governor Inslee, thank you.
253	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	Congressman O’Rourke, you also put out a big climate change plan from your campaign. You want some big changes in a pretty short period of time, including switching to renewable energy, pushing to replace gas-powered cars in favor of electric ones. What’s your message to a voter who supports the overall goal of what you’re trying to do, but suddenly feels as if government’s telling them how to live and ordering them how to live? What is that balance like?
254	O’ROURKE	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	I think you’ve got to bring everybody in to the decisions and the solutions to the challenges that we face. That’s why we’re traveling everywhere, listening to everyone. We were in Pacific Junction, a town that had never meaningly flooded before, just up against the Missouri River in Iowa. And every home in that community had flooded. There were farms just outside of Pacific Junction that were effectively lakes, those farmers already underwater in debt, their markets closed to them by a trade war under this administration, and now they don’t know what to do. We in our administration are going fund resiliency in those communities, in Miami, in Houston, Texas, those places that are on the front lines of climate change today. We’re going to mobilize $5 trillion in this economy over the next 10 years. We’re going to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels, and we’re going to put farmers and ranchers in the driver’s seat, renewable and sustainable agriculture, to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil, paying farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide. If all of us does all that we can, then we’re going to be able to keep this planet from warming another 2 degrees Celsius, and ensure that we match what this country can do and live up to our promise and our potential.
255	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	Thirty seconds, Secretary Castro, does — who pays for the mitigation to — to climate, whether it’s building sea walls, for people that are perhaps living in places that they shouldn’t be living? Is this a federal government issue that needs to do that? Do they have to move these people? What do you do about that, where maybe they’re building a place someplace that isn’t safe? Who pays to build that house? And how much should the government be bailing them out?
256	CASTRO	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	Well, I don’t think that that represents the vast majority of the issue. In fact, you know, my first visit after I announced my candidacy wasn’t to Iowa or New Hampshire. It was to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Because people should know that if I’m elected president, everybody will count. And, you know, I’m one of the few candidates in this race with executive experience, with a track record of getting things done. When I was mayor of San Antonio, we moved our local public utility, we began to shift it from coal-fired plants to solar and other renewables, and also created more than 800 jobs doing that. And when I was HUD secretary, we worked on the National Disaster Resilience Competition to invest in communities that were trying to rebuild from natural disasters in a sustainable way. That’s the way that we’re going to help make sure that we’re all safer in the years to come and that we combat climate change.
257	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	Thank you.
258	CASTRO	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	And if I’m elected president, the first thing that I would do, like Senator Klobuchar also has said, is sign an executive order recommitting us to the Paris Climate Accord so that we lead again…
259	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	All right. Congressman Ryan, I got a full question for you here, which is simply this. There are — a lot of the climate plans include pricing carbon, taxing carbon in some way. This type of proposal has been tried in a few places, whether it’s Washington state where voters voted it down, you’ve had the Yellow Vest Movement, we had in Australia one party get rejected out of fear of the cost of climate change sort of being put on the backs of the consumer. If pricing carbon is just politically impossible, how do we pay for climate mitigation?
260	RYAN	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	Well, there is a variety of different ways to pay. We talked about different ways of raising revenue. And I think we’ve got to build our way out of this and grow our way out of this. But let me just talk real quick to the previous question about real politics. We could talk about climate, we could talk about guns, we could talk about all of these issues that we all care about. We have a perception problem with the Democratic Party. We are not connecting to the working class people in the very states that I represent in Ohio, in the industrial Midwest. We’ve lost all connection. We have got to change the center of gravity of the Democratic Party from being coastal and elital — elitist and Ivy League, which is the perception, to somebody from the forgotten communities that have been left behind for the last 30 years, to get those workers back on our side so we can say we’re going to build electric vehicles, we’re going to build solar panels. But if you want to beat Mitch McConnell, this better be a working-class party. If you want to go into Kentucky and take his rear end out, and if you want to take Lindsey Graham out, you’ve got to have a blue collar party that can go into the textile communities in South Carolina. So all I’m saying here…
261	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	Thank you, Congressman Ryan.
262	RYAN	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	All I’m saying here…
263	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	Thank you, Congressman Ryan.
264	CASTRO	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	So, Chuck, Chuck…
265	RYAN	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	All I’m saying is here, if we don’t address that fundamental problem with our connection to workers — white, black, brown, gay, straight — working-class people…
266	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	Thank you, Congressman.
267	RYAN	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	… none of this is going to get done, Chuck.
268	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	Thank you very much.
269	(UNKNOWN)	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	Chuck…
270	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	I want to you — we’re going to keep moving. Congressman Delaney, I’m going to get to you…
271	DELANEY	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	This is — I introduced the only bipartisan carbon tax bill…
272	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	Thirty seconds — all right, 30 seconds, go.
273	DELANEY	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	This is really important. All the economists agree that a carbon pricing mechanism works. You just have to do it right. You can’t put a price on carbon, raise energy prices, and not give the money back to the American people. My proposal, which is put a price on carbon, give a dividend back to the American people. It goes out one pocket, back in the other.
274	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	Thank you, Congressman.
275	DELANEY	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	I can get that passed my first year as president with a coalition of every Democrat in the Congress and the Republicans who live in coastal states.
276	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	Thank you. Congressman, thank you.
277	DELANEY	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	Because Republicans in Florida, they actually care about this issue.
278	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	OK. Thank you very much.
279	DELANEY	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	This has got to be our way forward if we’re actually serious about this issue.
319	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	I want to go down the line here, finish up foreign policy. It’s a simple question. What is our — what is the biggest threat — what is — who is the geopolitical threat to the United States? Just give me a one-word answer, Congressman Delaney.
320	DELANEY	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Could you repeat the question?
321	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Greatest geopolitical threat to the United States right now. Congressman Delaney?
322	DELANEY	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Well, the biggest geopolitical challenge is China. But the biggest geopolitical threat remains nuclear weapons.
323	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	OK.
324	DELANEY	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Right, so those are — you know, those are different questions.
325	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	I got you. Totally get it. Go ahead. Governor Inslee?
326	INSLEE	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	The biggest threat to the security of the United States is Donald Trump. And there’s no question about it.
327	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Congresswoman Gabbard?
328	GABBARD	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	The greatest…
329	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Greatest geopolitical threat.
330	GABBARD	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	The greatest threat that we face is the fact that we’re in a greater risk of nuclear war today than ever before in history.
331	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Senator Klobuchar?
332	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Two threats, economic threat, China, but our major threat right now is what’s going in the Mideast with Iran, if we don’t get…
333	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	OK, try to keep it at one — slimmer than what we’ve been going here. One or two words.
334	O’ROURKE	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Our existential threat is climate change. We have to confront it before it’s too late.
335	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Senator Warren?
336	INSLEE	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Climate change.
337	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Yeah. Senator Booker?
338	BOOKER	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Nuclear proliferation and climate change.
339	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Secretary Castro?
340	CASTRO	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	China and climate change.
341	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Congressman Ryan?
342	RYAN	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	China, without a question. They’re wiping us around the world economically.
343	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	And Mr. Mayor?
344	De Blasio	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	BLASIO: Russia, because they’re trying to undermine our democracy and they’ve been doing a pretty damn good job of it, and we need to stop them.
345	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	All right. Well, thank you for that wide variety of answers, and I mean that. No, I mean that in — that’s what this debate is about. This is the best part of a debate like this. Congressman O’Rourke, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report outlines multiple instances of potential criminal behavior by President Trump. House Speaker Pelosi has publicly and privately resisted any move toward impeachment in the House. If the House chooses not to impeach, as president, would you do anything to address the potential crimes that were outlined in Mr. Mueller’s report?
349	TODD	Moderator	22.0	Impeachment	Thank you, Congressman O’Rourke.
350	MADDOW	Moderator	22.0	Impeachment	Congressman Delaney, because of the accountability issues that Congressman O’Rourke was just describing there and the real political landscape in which Nancy Pelosi is saying that impeachment will not be pursued in the House, it raises the prospect — and the Mueller Report raises the prospect that President Trump could be prosecuted for some of those potential crimes down the line. No U.S. president has ever been prosecuted for crimes after leaving office. Do you believe that President Trump could or should be the first?
351	DELANEY	Candidate	22.0	Impeachment	I guess there’s always a first.
352	MADDOW	Moderator	22.0	Impeachment	Should he be?
353	DELANEY	Candidate	22.0	Impeachment	I don’t think anyone is above the law. I don’t think anyone is above the law, including a president. I support Speaker Pelosi’s decisions that she is making in the House of Representatives right now as speaker. I think she knows more about the decision as to whether to impeach the president than any of the 2020 candidates combined.
354	MADDOW	Moderator	22.0	Impeachment	Conceded. On the issue of prosecution…
355	DELANEY	Candidate	22.0	Impeachment	So — but I do think — I do think the — no one is above the law, and this president, who is lawless, should not be above the law. But I will tell you, Rachel, the one thing when you’re out doing as much campaigning as I’ve done, 400 events, all 99 counties in Iowa, this is not the number-one issue the American people ask us about. It’s not. They want to know what we’re going to do for health care, how we’re going to lower pharmaceutical prices, how we’re going to build infrastructure, what we’re going to do to create jobs in their communities. You know, last year in our country, 80 percent of the money for start-up businesses went to 50 counties in this country. There’s over 3,000 counties in this country. That’s what they care about. They care about what’s going on in the public schools. They care about what’s going on with jobs in their communities, with their pay, with their health care, with infrastructure. These are the issues, these kind of kitchen-table, pocket-book issues…
356	MADDOW	Moderator	22.0	Impeachment	Understood.
357	DELANEY	Candidate	22.0	Impeachment	… are actually what most Americans care about. They never ask about the Mueller Report.
358	MADDOW	Moderator	22.0	Impeachment	Congressman, thank you. Your time is up.
359	DELANEY	Candidate	22.0	Impeachment	They never ask about it. They want to know how we’re going to solve these problems.
360	MADDOW	Moderator	22.0	Impeachment	Your time’s…
361	TODD	Moderator	22.0	Impeachment	Here’s the thing. I still — Senator…
362	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	22.0	Impeachment	… but if we let the Republicans run our elections and if do not do something about Russian interference in the election and we let Mitch McConnell stop all the backup paper ballots, then we’re not going to get what we want to do.
363	TODD	Moderator	22.0	Impeachment	I’ve got to sneak in — we blew through a break, which was good news, to give you more time, so I got to sneak one in now. More of this debate. It’s picking up here. It continues right after this.
456	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	4.0	Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	BALART: Before we do I want to say hello and good evening, Buenos noches to Mayor Buttigieg.
458	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	4.0	Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	BALART: (UNTRANSLATED) Many of your colleagues on stage support free college. You do not. Why not?
511	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Senator, your time is up. I want to put that same question to Mayor Buttigieg.
512	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Yeah, we’ve taught look, everybody who says Medicare for All, every person in politics who allows that phrase to escape their lips has a responsibility to explain how you’re actually supposed to get from here to there. Now here’s how I would do it. It’s very similar. I would call it Medicare for All Who Want It. you take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, and you make it available on the exchanges it. People can buy in. and then if people like us are right that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single payer environment. But, let’s remember even in countries that have outright socialized medicine, like England, even there there’s still a private sector, that’s fine. It’s just that for our primary care we can’t be relying on the tender verses of the corporate system. This one is very personal for me. I started out this year dealing with a terminal illness of my father. I make decisions for a living and nothing could have prepared me for the kind of decisions our family faced. But, the thing we had going for us was that we never had to make those decisions based on whether it was gonna bankrupt our family because of Medicare. And I want every–
513	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Time.
514	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And I want every family to have that same freedom to do what is medically right, not (INAUDIBLE).
515	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Your time is complete. Vice President Biden, I want to put the question to you. You were an ar–one of the architects of Obama Care. So, where do we go from here?
516	BIDEN	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Look, this is a very personal to me. When my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident my two boys were really very badly injured. I couldn’t imagine what it’d be like had I not had adequate healthcare available immediately. And then when my son came home from Iraq after a year he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and he was given months to live. I can’t fathom what would have happened if, in fact, they said by the way the last six months of your life you’re on your own. We’re cutting off. You’ve used up your time. The fact of the matter is that the quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obama Care, to build on what we did. And secondly, secondly, to make sure that everyone does have an option. Everyone, whether they have private insurance, employer insurance or no insurance, they, in fact, can buy into the exchange to a Medicare like plan. And the way you do that, you can do it quicker look, urgency matters. There’s people right now facing what I’ve faced and what we’ve faced without any of the help I had. We must move now. I’m against any democrat who opposes–in fact–
517	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Vice President Biden, your time is–
518	BIDEN	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Takes down Obama Care and any republican who wants to get rid of it.
519	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Let me–let me turn to Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders, you have basically–you basically want to scrap the private health insurance system as we know it and replace it with a government run plan. None of the states that have tried something like that, California, Vermont, New York has struggled with it, have been successful. If politicians can’t make it work in those states how would you implement it on a national level. How does this work?
520	SANDERS	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Lester, I find it hard to believe that every other major country on earth, including my neighbor 50 miles north of me, Canada, somehow has figured out a way to provide healthcare to every man, woman and child, and in most cases they’re spending 50 percent per capita of what we are spending. Let’s be clear, let us be very clear the function of healthcare today from the insurance and drug company perspective is not to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way. The function of the healthcare system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies. And, last year, if you could believe it, while we paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and I will lower prescription drug prices in half in this country, top ten companies made $69 billion in profit. They will spend 100’s of millions of dollars lying to the American people telling us why we cannot have a–
521	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Senator–
522	SANDERS	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Medicare for All.
523	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I just have to follow up there, how do you implement it on a national level.
524	SANDERS	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I’m sorry?
525	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	How do you implement it on a national level given the fact that it’s not succeeded in other states that have tried?
526	SANDERS	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I will tell you how we’ll do it. We’ll do it the way real change has always taken place, whether it was the labor movement, the civil rights movement or the women’s movement.
527	SANDERS	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We will have Medicare for all when tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up and tell the insurance companies and the drug companies that their day is gone, that healthcare is a human right, not something to make huge profits off of.
528	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	All right. Ms. Williamson–Ms. Williamson this is a question for you.
529	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Excuse me, excuse me. I am addressing the question to Ms. Williamson. We have been talking a lot about access to health insurance but for many Americans their most pressing concern is the high cost of healthcare. How would you lower the cost of prescription drugs?
530	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Well, first of all the government should never have made the deal with the big farm at that they couldn’t negotiate; that was just part of the regular corruption by which multinational corporations have their way with us. You know I wanted to say that while I agree with–I–I’m with Senator Bennet and others but I agree with almost everything here I will tell you one thing it’s really nice if we got all these plans but if you think we are going to beat Donald Trump by just having all of these plans you’ve got another thing coming because he didn’t when by saying he had a plan. He won by simply saying make America great again. We’ve got to get deeper than just the superficial fixes as important as they are. Even if we are just talking about the superficial fixes ladies and gentlemen we don’t have a health care system in the United States, we have a sickness care system in the United States. We just wait until somebody gets sick and then we talk about who’s going to pay for the treatment and how they are going to be treated. What we need to talk about is why so many Americans have unnecessary chronic illnesses so many more compared to other countries and that gets back into not just the big Pharma, not just health insurance companies, it has to do with chemical policies, it has to do with environmental policies–
531	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	All right, Ms. Williamson your time–
532	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–it has to do with food policies– It has to do with drug policies.
533	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Thank you.
534	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	It even has to do with environmental policies.
535	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Thank you. Senator–Senator Bennet, a question for you do you want to keep a system that we have in place with Obamacare and build on it? You mentioned that a moment ago. Is that enough to get us to universal coverage?
536	BENNET	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I believe that will get us the quickest way there and I bought the vice president was very moving about this and Mayor Pete as well. I had prostate cancer recently as you may know and that is why I was a little late getting in the race these same week my kid had her appendectomy out and I feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice. I think that is what the American people want. I believe it will get us there quickly. There are millions of people in America that do not have health insurance today because they can’t–they are too wealthy. Wealthy? They make too much money to be on Medicaid, they can’t afford health insurance. When Senator Sanders says that Canada is single payer, there are 35 million people in Canada. There are 330 million people in the United States easily the number of people on a public option. It could easily be 35 million and for them it would be Medicare for all as mayor Buttigieg says but for others that want to keep it they should be able to keep it. And I think that will be the fastest way to get where we need to go. Also I will say Bernie is a very honest person. He has said over and over again unlike others that have supported this legislation over and over again that this will band making it illegal all insurance except cosmetic, except insurance for I guess that’s where plastic surgery. Everything else is banned under the Medicare for all proposal–
537	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I–I let–I let you go a little long there but I want–but obviously Senator Sanders you have got a response.
538	HARRIS	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I would like to add a point here.
539	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Senator Sanders (INAUDIBLE).
540	SANDERS	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Just very briefly you know Mike, Medicare is the most popular–
541	BENNET	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I agree.
542	SANDERS	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	— Health insurance program in the country. People don’t like their private insurance companies, they like their doctors and hospitals. Under our plan people go to any doctor they want, any hospital they want. We will substantially lower the cost of healthcare in this country because we will stop the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
543	HARRIS	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	On this issue–on this issue we have to think about how this affects real people–
544	(UNKNOWN)	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	(INAUDIBLE) lifetime, (INAUDIBLE) for all and today–
545	HARRIS	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	The reality of how this affects real people is captured in a story that many of us heard and I will para–paraphrase there is in the unite–America a parent who is seeing that their child has a temperature that is out of control, calls 911 what should I do and they say take the child to the emergency room and so they get in their car and they drive and there sitting in the parking lot outside of the emergency room looking at those sliding glass doors while they have the hand on the four head of their child knowing that if they walk through those sliding glass doors even though they have insurance they will be out 5000 deductible–$5000 deductible when they walk through those doors.
546	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Senator, Senator–
547	HARRIS	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	That is what insurance companies are doing in America today.
548	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We’re going to continue this discussion–
549	SWALWELL	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–I’m one of those parents–
550	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I wanted to put it in–
551	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Candidates, please.
552	SWALWELL	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I’m one of those parents. I was just in the emergency room with my eight month old–
553	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Candidates, please–
554	SWALWELL	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–I’m one of those parents. I was just in the emergency room. And I’m telling you–
555	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Congressman, thank you–
556	SWALWELL	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–We fight health insurance companies every single week.
557	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Thank you.
558	SWALWELL	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We stand in line and pay expensive prescription drugs. We have to have a healthcare guarantee. If you’re sick, you’re seen it. And in America, you never go broke because of it.
559	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Okay.
560	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	With all due respect–
561	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–A lot of you have been talking tonight about these government healthcare plans that you proposed in one form or another. This is a show of hands question. And hold them up for a moment so people can see. Raise your hand if–if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
562	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Okay. Let me start with you, Mayor Buttigieg. Why? Mayor Buttigieg, why?
563	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Because our country is healthier when everybody is healthier. And remember, we’re talking about something people are getting a–given a chance to buy into. In the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes directly or indirectly. This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program. And we do ourselves no favor by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access healthcare. But of course, the real problem is we shouldn’t have 11 million undocumented people with no pathway to citizenship. It makes no sense. And the American people– The American people agree on what to do. This is the crazy thing. If leadership consists of–of forming a consensus around a divisive issue, this White House has divided us around a consensus issue. The American people want a pathway to citizenship. They wanted protections for Dreamers. We need to clean up the lawful immigration system, like how my father immigrated to this country. And as part of a compromise, we can do whatever commonsense measures are needed at the border.
564	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Mayor–
565	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–But Washington can’t deliver on something the American people want. What does that tell you about the system we’re living in? It tells you it needs profound–
566	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Mayor, thank you–
567	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Structural reform.
568	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Vice President Biden, I believe you said that your– Health care plan would not cover undocumented immigrants. Could you explain your position?
569	BIDEN	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I’m sorry. I beg your pardon. I didn’t hear.
570	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I believe at the show of hands you did not raise her hand. Did you raise your hand?
571	BIDEN	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Oh, no, I did. I–but
572	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Okay. Sorry. Sorry. I–so, you said that they would be covered under your plan–
573	BIDEN	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Yes–
574	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Which is different than Obama Care.
575	BIDEN	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Yes. But here–here’s the thing.
576	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Can you explain that change?
577	BIDEN	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Yes. You cannot let–as the mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered. You can’t do that. It’s just going to be taking care of, period. You have to. It’s the humane thing to do. But here’s the deal. The deal is that he’s right about three things. Number one, they in fact contribute to the well-being of the country, but they also–for example, they’ve increased the lifespan of Social Security because they’re–they have a job. They’re paying the Social Security tax. That’s what they’re doing. It’s increase the lifespan. They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of healthcare by them being able to be treated and not wait until there in extremis. The other thing is, folks, look, we can deal with these insurance companies. We can deal with insurance companies by, number one, putting insurance executives in jail for their misleading–their misleading advertising, what they’re doing on opioids– –What they’re doing paying doctors to prescribe. We should–we could be doing this by making sure everyone who is on Medicare–that the government should be able to negotiate the price for what–whatever the drug costs are. We can do this by making sure that we’re in a position that we in fact allow people–you mean time’s up?
578	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I just want to address–
579	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Your time’s up. Vice President Biden, thank you.
580	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Actually, you can hold off a minute. We need to take a short break here. We got a lot more we need to talk to all of you about, so stick with us. We’re just getting started. We’ll be back with more from Miami right after this.
585	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	BALART: Hickenlooper day one if you are–day one at the White House how do you respond?
586	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	With these–with these children?
587	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	BALART: Let me get to you in–in–in just a second.
588	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I’m sorry.
589	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	BALART: Governor, day one, thousands of men, women and children cross the border asking for asylum for a better life. What do you do? One, day one, hour one?
590	HICKENLOOPER	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Certainly the images we’ve seen this week just compound the emotional impact that the world is judging us by. If you had ever told me any time in my life that this country would sanction federal agents to take children from the arms of their parents, put them in cages, actually put them up for adoption–in Colorado we call that kidnapping. I–I would have called you– I would have told you it was unbelievable. And the first thing we have to do is recognize the humanitarian crisis on the border for what it is and make sure there are the sufficient facil-facilities in place so that women and children are not separated from their families. The children are with their families. We have to make sure that–that ICE is completely reformed. And they begin looking at their job in a humanitarian way where they are addressing the whole needs of the people that they are engaged with along the border. And we have to make sure, ultimately, that we provide not just shelter, but food, clothing and access to medical care.
591	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	BALART: Ms. Williamson.
592	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Yes, what Donald Trump has done to these children and it’s not just in Colorado, Governor, you’re right–it is kidnapping. And it’s extremely important for us to realize that. If you forcibly take a child from their parents arms you are kidnapping them. And if you take a lot of children and you put them in a detainment center thus inflicting chronic trauma upon them that’s called child abuse. This is collective child abuse.
593	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	This is collective child abuse. And when this is crime–both of those things are a crime and if your government does it that doesn’t make it less of a crime. These are state-sponsored crimes. And what President–and what President Trump has done is not only attack these children, not only demonize these immigrants, he is attacking a basic principle of America’s moral core. We open our hearts to the stranger. This is extremely important and it’s also important for all of us remember and I have great respect for everyone who is on this–on this–on this stage but we are going to talk about what to do about healthcare. Well, where have you been guys? Because if it’s not just the matter of a plan and I haven’t heard anybody on this stage who has talked about American foreign policy in Latin America and how we might have in the last few decades contributed to something being more helpful(SP).
594	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Senator Gillibrand what would you do as President with a reality?
595	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Well, one of the worst things about President Trump that he has done to this country is he has torn apart the moral fabric of who we are. When he started separating children at the border from their parents the fact that seven children have died in his custody, the fact that dozens of children have been separated from their parents and they have no plan to reunite them so I would do a few things. First, I would fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. Second, I would reform how we treat asylum-seekers at the border. I would have a community-based treatment center where you are doing it within the communities where asylum-seekers are given lawyers, where there is real immigration judges, not employees of the Atty. Gen. but appointed for life and have a community-based system. I would fund borders security but the worst thing President Trump has done is he has diverted the funds away from cross-border terrorism, cross-border human trafficking, drug trafficking and gun trafficking and he is given that money to the for-profit prisons. I would not be spending money in for profit prisons–
596	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We had–
597	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–to lock up children and asylum-seekers.
598	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We had a very spirited debate on this stage last night on the topic of decriminalization of the border. If–if you would be so kind raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross the border without documentation? Can we keep the hands up so we can see them?
599	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Let’s remember that’s not just a theoretical exercise, that criminalization that is the basis for family separation. You do away with that it is no longer possible. Of course it wouldn’t be possible anyway in my presidency because it is dead wrong. We have got to talk about one other thing because the Republican Party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion. Now our party doesn’t talk about that as much largely for a very good reason which was we are committed to the separation of church and state and we stand for people of any religion and people of no religion. But we should call out hypocrisy when we see it in for a party that associates itself with Christianity to say that it is okay to suggest that God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents, that God would condone putting children in cages has lost all claim to ever use religious language again.
600	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Mr. vice president I don’t know if you raised your hand or word just asking to speak–
601	BIDEN	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Look–
602	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Would you decriminalize crossing the border without documents?
603	BIDEN	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	The first thing I would do is unite families. I would surge immediately billions of dollars’ worth of help to the region the immediately. Look, I talk about foreign policy. I am the guy that got a bipartisan agreement at the very end of the campaign, at the very end of our term to spend $740 million to deal with the problem and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place. It was working. We saw as you know a net decrease in the number of children who were coming. The crisis was updated and along came this President and he said he immediately discontinued that. We all talk about these things, I did it. I did it. 740–now look, second thing–second thing we have to do, the law now requires the reuniting of those families. We would reunite those families period and if not we would put those children in a circumstance where they were safe until we could find their parents. And lastly the idea that he is in court with his Justice Department saying children in cages do not need a bed, do not need a blanket, do not need a toothbrush–
604	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Vice President–
605	BIDEN	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	That is outrageous.
606	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	The Obama-Biden administration was– The Obama-Biden administration deported more than three million Americans. My question to you is if an individual is living in the United States of America without documents and that is his only offense, should that person be deported?
607	BIDEN	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Depending if they committed a–a major crime, they should be deported. And the President was left in his–President Obama I think did a heck of a job. To compare him to what–what this guy is doing is absolutely, I find–close to immoral. But the fact is that, look, we should not be locking people up. We should be making sure we change the circumstance, as we did, why they would leave in the first place. And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them, keep them safe until they can be heard.
608	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	A 15-second, if you could, if you wish to answer, should someone who is here without documents, and that is his only offense, should that person be deported?
609	BIDEN	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	That person should not be the focus of deportation. We should fundamentally change the way we deal with things.
610	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Senator?
611	SANDERS	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I want to–
612	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–I think it’s important–
613	SANDERS	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Suggest that I agree with a lot of what Kamala just said, and that is on day one we take out our executive order pen and we rescind every damn thing on this issue that Trump has done. Number two–number two, picking up on the point that Joe made, we got a look at the root causes. And you have a situation where Honduras, among other things, is a failing state, massive corruption. You got gangs who are telling families that if a 10-year-old does not join their gang, their family is going to be killed. What we have got to do on day one and invite the presidents and the leadership of Central America and Mexico together. This is a hemispheric–
614	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Thank you–
615	SANDERS	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Problem that we have got to address.
616	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Congressman Swalwell? What do you do?
617	SWALWELL	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Day one?
618	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	No. If someone is here without documents and that is their only offense, is that person to be deported?
619	SWALWELL	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	No, that person can be a part of this great American experience. That person can contribute. My congressional district is one of the most diverse in America, and we see the benefits when people contribute and they become a part of the community and they’re not in the shadow economy. Day one for me, families are reunited. This president, though, for immigrants, there is nothing he will not do two separate a family, cage a child, or erase their existence by weaponizing the census. And there is nothing that we cannot do in the courts and that I will not do as president to reverse that and to make sure that families always belong together.
620	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Senator Harris?
621	HARRIS	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Well, thank you. I will say, no, absolutely not. They should not be deported. And I actually–this was one of the very few issues with which I disagreed with the administration, with whom I otherwise had a great relationship and a great deal of respect. But on the secure communities issue, I was Attorney General of California. I led the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, in a state of 40 million people. And on this issue, I disagreed with my president, because the policy was to allow deportation of people who, by ICE’s own definition, were non-criminals. So, as Attorney General and the chief law officer of the state of California, I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state that they did not have to comply with detainers and instead should make decisions based on the best interest of public safety of their community. Because what I saw–and I was tracking it every day. I was tracking it and saw that–that parents, people who had not committed a crime even by ICE’s own definition, were being deported. And–but I have to add a point here. The problem with this kind of policy, and I know it as a prosecutor–
622	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator–
623	HARRIS	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–I want a rape victim to be able to run in the middle–
624	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator–
625	HARRIS	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Of a–to run in the middle of the street and waved down a police officer and report the crime against her. I want anybody who has been the victim–
626	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator–
627	HARRIS	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Of any real crime–
628	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator–
629	HARRIS	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–To be able to do that–
630	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Your time–
631	HARRIS	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–And not be afraid that, if they do that–
632	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator–
633	HARRIS	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–They will be deported because the abuser–
634	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator–
635	HARRIS	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Will tell them it is they who is the criminal. It is wrong.
636	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We’re going to turn–
637	HARRIS	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–It is wrong–
638	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–We’re going to turn to the issue of trade now, if we can.
639	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Last night we ask the candidates on this stage to name the greatest geopolitical threat facing the U.S. Four of them mentioned China. U.S. businesses say China steals our intellectual property and party leaders on both sides accuse China of manipulating their currency to keep the cost of goods artificially low. I’ll ask this to Senator Bennet to start off with, how would you stand up to China?
640	BENNET	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I think that, first of all, the biggest–the biggest threat to our national security right now is Russia, not China. And, second, on China we’ve got comp–because of what they’ve done with our election. In China, I think the president’s been right to push back on China but he’s done it in completely the wrong way. We should mobilize the entire rest of the world who all have a shared interest in pushing back on China’s mercantilist trade policies and I think we can do that. I’d like to answer the other question before this as well.
641	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	You–you have the time–
642	BENNET	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	When I–when I–when I see these kids at the border, I see my mom because I know she sees herself because she was separated from her parents for years during the holocaust in Poland. And for Donald Trump to be doing what he’s doing to children and their families at the borders I say this as somebody who wrote the immigration bill in 2013 that created a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people in this country that had the most progressive DREAM Act that’s ever been conceived, much less passed, it got 68 votes in the Senate, that had $46 billion of border security in it that was sophisticated 21st century border security, not a medieval wall that the president has–
643	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator, the time–sorry–
644	BENNET	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Turned the border of the United States into a symbol of nativist hostility that the whole world is looking at when what we should be represented by is–
645	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator, thank you.
646	BENNET	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–The Statue of Liberty, which has brought my parents to this country to begin with. We need to make a change.
689	BIDEN	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Mm-hmm.
690	HARRIS	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	But, I also believe–and it’s personal. And I–I was actually very–it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose bussing. And you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bussed to school every day and that little girl was me. So, I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly. As attorney general of California, I was very proud to put in place a–a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on.
691	MADDOW	Moderator	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Senator Harris, thank you. Vice President Biden, you have been invoked. We are going to give you a chance to respond.
692	BIDEN	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	That’s a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I did not praise racists. That is not true, number one. Number two, if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether I did or not, I’m happy to do that. I was a public defender. I didn’t become a prosecutor. I came out and I left a good law firm to become a public defender when in fact — when in fact — when in fact my city was in flames because of the–the assassination of Dr. King, number one. Now, number two, as the U.S.–as–excuse me–as the vice president of the United States, I worked with a man who in fact, we worked very hard to see to it we dealt with these issues in a major, major way. The fact is that in terms of busing, the busing, I never–you would’ve been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council. That’s fine. That’s one of the things I argued for that we should not be–we should be breaking down these lines. But–so, the bottom line here is, look, everything I have done in my career–I ran because of civil rights. I continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights. And those civil rights, by the way, include not just African Americans, but the LGBT community. They don’t–
693	HARRIS	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–But, Vice President Biden do you agree today–do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then?
694	BIDEN	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	No.
695	HARRIS	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Do you agree?
696	BIDEN	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I did not oppose bussing in America. What I opposed is bussing ordered by the Department of Education. That’s what I opposed. I did not oppose–
697	HARRIS	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–Well, there was a failure of–of states to–to integrate–
698	BIDEN	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–No, but–
699	HARRIS	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–Public schools in America. I was part of the second class to integrate, Berkley, California Public Schools almost two decades after Brown v. Board of Education.
700	BIDEN	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Because your city council made that decision. It was a local decision.
701	HARRIS	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	So, that’s where the federal government must step in.
702	BIDEN	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	The–the federal government must–
703	HARRIS	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–That’s why we have the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act. That’s why we need to pass the Equality Act. That’s why we need to pass the ERA because there are–
704	BIDEN	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–That–
705	HARRIS	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–Moments in-
706	HARRIS	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people.
707	BIDEN	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I have supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran for (INAUDIBLE).
708	TODD	Moderator	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Vice President Biden 30 seconds because I want to bring other people into this.\
709	BIDEN	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I–I supported the ERA from the very beginning. I am the guy that extended the voting rights act for 25 years. We got to the place where we got 98 out of 98 votes in the United States Senate doing it. I have also argued very strongly that we in fact deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box. I agree that everybody once they in fact–my time is up. I’m sorry.
710	TODD	Moderator	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Thank you vice president.
711	HARRIS	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	All of these things (INAUDIBLE).
830	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	We’re going to sneak in a break in a minute, but before we go, I’m going to go down the line here and I’m asking you please, for one or two words. All right? Please.
831	MADDOW	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Really.
832	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	President Obama, in his first year, wanted to address both healthcare and climate and he could only get one signature issue accomplished. It was, obviously, healthcare. He didn’t get to do climate change. You may only get one shot and your first issue that you’re going to push–you get one shot that it may be the only thing you get passed, what is that first issue for your presidency? Eric Swalwell, you’re first.
833	SWALWELL	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	For Parkland, for Orlando, for every community effected by gun violence, ending gun violence.
834	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Senator Bennet?
835	BENNET	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Climate change and the lack of economic mobility Bernie talks about.
836	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Senator Gillibrand?
837	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Passing a family bill of rights that includes a national paid leave plan, universal Pre-K, affordable daycare and making sure that women and families can thrive in the workplace no matter who they are.
838	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	All right.
839	HARRIS	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Oh, I like that.
840	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Senator Harris?
841	HARRIS	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	So, passing a middle class and working families tax cut.
842	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	That’s one.
843	HARRIS	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	DACA, guns.
844	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	I’ll give you credit for the first thing you said, the tax cut. Senator Sanders, first thing?
845	SANDERS	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	The premise that there’s only one or two issues out there.
846	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	I’m not saying there’s only one or two.
847	SANDERS	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	is enormous crisis.
848	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Senator Sanders–
849	SANDERS	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	–We need a political revolution. People have got to stand up and take on the special interests. We can transform this country.
850	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Vice President Biden, your first issue, Mr. Vice President?
851	BIDEN	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	I think you’ve so underestimated what Barack Obama did. He’s the first man to bring together the entire world, 196 nations to commit to deal with climate change immediately. I don’t–I don’t buy that. The first–the first thing I would do is make sure that we defeat Donald Trump.
852	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Okay.
853	BIDEN	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Period.
854	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Mayor Buttigieg, your first priority, your first issue as president that you are going to block and tackle?
855	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	We’ve got to fix our democracy before it’s too late. Get that right and climate, immigration, taxes and every other issue gets better.
856	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Mr.–Mr. Yang?
857	YANG	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	I would pass a $1,000 freedom dividend for every American adult starting at age 18. Which would speed us up on climate change because if you get the boot off of people’s throats they’re (INAUDIBLE) climate change much more clearly.
858	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Okay. Governor Hickenlooper?
859	HICKENLOOPER	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	I would do a collaborative approach to climate change and I would pronounce it well before the election to make sure we don’t reelect the worst president in American history.
860	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	And Ms. Williamson, you have the last word.
861	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	My first call is to Prime Minister of New Zealand who said that her role is to make New Zealand the place where it’s the best place in the world for a child to grow up. And I would tell her, girlfriend, you are so wrong because the United States of America is going to be the best place–
862	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Thank you.
863	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	–In the world for a child to grow up. We are going to have–
864	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	–Thank you. You guys were close with the short–at least it was shorter.
865	MADDOW	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	No, they weren’t, not at all.
866	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	All right, C-minus.
16	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	2.0	Klobuchar's rivals programs	Well, first, the economy. We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity. And Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what’s going on, when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums. So I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids. I do. But I think my plan is a good one. And my plan would be to, first of all, make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education. My own dad and my sister got their first degrees with community college. There’s many paths to success, as well as certifications. Secondly, I’d used Pell grants. I’d double them from $6,000 to $12,000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered, to families that make up to $100,000. And then the third thing I would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans. Because I can tell you this: If billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.
19	O’ROURKE	Candidate	3.0	Top tax rate	This economy has got to work for everyone. And right now, we know that it isn’t. And it’s going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Right now, we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes. That’s how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest. A $2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality. A new democracy that is revived because we’ve returned power to the people, no PACs, no gerrymandering, automatic and same-day voter registration to bring in more voters, and a new Voting Rights Act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now…
20	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Top tax rate	Congressman O’Rourke…
21	O’ROURKE	Candidate	3.0	Top tax rate	That’s how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody.
22	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Top tax rate	Congressman, that’s time, sir. I’ll give you 10 seconds to answer if you want to answer the direct question. Would you support a 70 percent individual marginal tax rate? Yes, no, or pass?
23	O’ROURKE	Candidate	3.0	Top tax rate	I would support a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone. Tax capital at the same right…
24	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Top tax rate	Seventy percent?
25	O’ROURKE	Candidate	3.0	Top tax rate	… that you — you tax ordinary income. Take that corporate tax rate up to 28 percent. You would generate the revenues…
26	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Top tax rate	OK, that’s time.
27	O’ROURKE	Candidate	3.0	Top tax rate	… you need to pay for the programs we’re talking about.
30	BOOKER	Candidate	4.0	breaking up of tech companies	I don’t think I disagree. I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation. And you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from labor, and we have people that work full-time jobs and still can’t make a living wage. We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs. And you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that’s hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete. One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector. So I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work. And I’ll tell you this. I live in a low-income black and brown community. I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans. The indicators that are being used, from GDP to Wall Street’s rankings, is not helping people in my community. It is about time that we have an economy that works for everybody, not just the wealthiest in our nation.
31	GUTHRIE	Moderator	4.0	breaking up of tech companies	But quickly, Senator Booker, you did say that you didn’t think it was right to name names, to name companies and single them out, as Senator Warren has. Briefly, why is that?
32	BOOKER	Candidate	4.0	breaking up of tech companies	Well, again, I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that. And when it comes to antitrust law, what I will do is, number one, appoint judges that will enforce it, number two, have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration. At the end of the day, we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing. We see that with everything from Citizens United and the way they’re trying to influence Washington. It’s about time that we have a president that fights for the people in this country…
33	GUTHRIE	Moderator	4.0	breaking up of tech companies	That’s time, sir.
34	BOOKER	Candidate	4.0	breaking up of tech companies	We need to have someone that’s a champion for them.
35	GUTHRIE	Moderator	4.0	breaking up of tech companies	Thank you, Senator. Senator Warren, I mentioned you … Are you picking winners and losers?
36	WARREN	Candidate	4.0	breaking up of tech companies	So the way I understand this, it’s there is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country. That hurts workers. It hurts small businesses. It hurts independent farmers. It hurts our economy overall. And it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy. Now, look, we’ve had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back. What’s been missing is courage, courage in Washington to take on the giants. That’s part of the corruption in this system. It has been far too long that the monopolies have been making the campaign contributions, have been funding the super PACs, have been out there making sure that their influence is heard and felt in every single decision that gets made in Washington. Where I want to start this is I want to return government to the people, and that means calling out the names of the monopolists and saying I have the courage to go after them.
39	CASTRO	Candidate	5.0	Gender Pay gap	Thank you very much for that question, Lester. You know, I grew up with a mother who raised my brother, Joaquin, and me as a single parent. And I know what it’s like to struggle. I know what it’s like to rent a home and to worry about whether you’re going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month and to see a mom work very, very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because they’re women. I would do several things, starting with something we should have done a long time ago, which is to pass the Equal Rights Amendment finally in this country. And also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country. It’s past time that we did that. And, you know, we have to do this. If we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century, we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve.
40	HOLT	Moderator	5.0	Gender Pay gap	All right, thank you. I want to put the same question to Congresswoman Gabbard. Your thoughts on equal pay?
43	De Blasio	Candidate	6.0	Income Inequality	BLASIO: Well, we’ve been addressing income inequality in New York City by raising wages, by raising benefits, by putting money back in the hands of working people, $15 minimum wage, paid sick days, pre-K for all, things that are making a huge difference in working people’s lives. But let me tell you, what we’re hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle for the heart and soul of our party. I want to make it clear. This is supposed to be the party of working people. Yes, we’re supposed to be for a 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy. Yes, we’re supposed to be for free college, free public college, for our young people. We are supposed to break up big corporations when they’re not serving our democracy. This Democratic Party has to be strong and bold and progressive. And in New York, we’ve proven that we can do something very different, we can put money back in the hands of working people. And let me tell you, every time you talk about investing in people and their communities, you hear folks say there’s not enough money. What I say to them every single time is, there’s plenty of money in this world, there’s plenty of money in this country. It’s just in the wrong hands. Democrats have to fix that. (APPLAUSE)
44	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	6.0	Income Inequality	Congressman Delaney, do you agree?
45	DELANEY	Candidate	6.0	Income Inequality	I think we have to do real things to help American workers and the American people. Right? This is the issue that all of us hear on the campaign trail. We need to make sure everyone has a living wage. And I’ve called for a doubling of the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating paid family leave. That will create a situation where people actually have a living wage. That gets right to workers. Then we’ve got to fix our public education system. It’s not delivering the results our kids needs, nor is college and post high school career and technical training programs doing that. You know, I’m very different than everyone else here on the stage. Prior to being in Congress, I was an entrepreneur. I started two businesses. I created thousands of jobs. I spent my whole career helping small- to mid-sized businesses all over the country, 5,000 of them I supported. The Obama administration gave me an award for lending to disadvantaged communities. I know how to create jobs. We need a short-term strategy which is to put money in the pockets of workers with the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating family leave, and then we need to have a long-term strategy to make sure this country is competitive and we’re creating jobs everywhere in this country.
46	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	6.0	Income Inequality	Thank you. Governor Inslee, how would you address income inequality?
49	RYAN	Candidate	7.0	Manufacturing Jobs	Yes, I believe you can, but, first, let’s say the president came, he said don’t sell your house to people in Youngstown, Ohio. And then his administration just in the last two years, we lost $4,000 — 4,000 jobs at a General Motors facility. That rippled throughout our community. General Motors got a tax cut. General Motors got a bailout. And then they have the audacity to move a new car that they’re going to produce to Mexico. I’ve had family members that have to unbolt a machine from the factory floor, put it in a box, and ship it to China. My area where I come from in northeast Ohio, this issue we’re talking about here, it’s been going on 40 years. This is not a new phenomenon in the United States of America. The bottom 60 percent haven’t seen a raise since 1980. Meanwhile, the top 1 percent control 90 percent of the wealth. We need an industrial policy saying we’re going to dominate building electric vehicles, there’s going to be 30 million made in the next 10 years. I want half of them made in the United States. I want to dominate the solar industry…
50	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	7.0	Manufacturing Jobs	Thank you.
51	RYAN	Candidate	7.0	Manufacturing Jobs	… and manufacture those here in the United States.
52	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	7.0	Manufacturing Jobs	Senator Warren, are they coming back? Are these jobs coming back?
53	WARREN	Candidate	7.0	Manufacturing Jobs	So we’ve had an industrial policy in the United States for decades now, and it’s basically been let giant corporations do whatever they want to do. Giant corporations have exactly one loyalty, and that is to profits. And if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to Canada, they’re going to do it. So here’s what I propose for an industrial policy. Start with a place where there’s a real need. There’s going to be a worldwide need for green technology, ways to clean up the air, ways to clean up the water. And we can be the ones to provide that. We need to go tenfold in our research and development on green energy going forward. And then we need to say any corporation can come and use that research. They can make all kinds of products from it, but they have to be manufactured right here in the United States of America. And then we have to double down and sell it around the world. There’s a $23 trillion market coming for green products. We should be the leaders and the owners, and we should have that 1.2 million manufacturing jobs here in America.
54	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	7.0	Manufacturing Jobs	Thank you.
57	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	Well, I think it’s a bold approach. It’s something that Barack Obama wanted to do when we were working on the Affordable Care Act. And that is a public option. I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in four years, which is exactly what this bill says. So let me go on beyond that. There is a much bigger issue in addition to that, and that is pharmaceuticals. The president literally went on TV, on Fox, and said that people’s heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices. Instead, 2,500 drugs have gone up in double-digits since he came into office. Instead, he gave $100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies. For the rest of us, for the rest of America, that’s what we call at home all foam and no beer. We got nothing out of it. And so my proposal is to do something about pharma, to take them on, to allow negotiation under Medicare, to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries. And pharma thinks they own Washington? Well, they don’t own me.
58	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Healthcare	Your time is up. Thank you. Senator Warren, you signed on to Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for all plan. It would put essentially everybody on Medicare and then eliminate private plans that offer similar coverage. Is that the plan or path that you would pursue as president?
59	WARREN	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	So, yes. I’m with Bernie on Medicare for all. And let me tell you why. I spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke. And one of the number-one reasons is the cost of health care, medical bills. And that’s not just for people who don’t have insurance. It’s for people who have insurance. Look at the business model of an insurance company. It’s to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your health care. That leaves families with rising premiums, rising copays, and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the health care that their doctors say that they and their children need. Medicare for all solves that problem. And I understand. There are a lot of politicians who say, oh, it’s just not possible, we just can’t do it, have a lot of political reasons for this. What they’re really telling you is they just won’t fight for it. Well, health care is a basic human right, and I will fight for basic human rights…
60	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Healthcare	Congressman O’Rourke, when you ran for Senate, you also praised a bill that would replace private insurance. This year, you’re saying you’re no longer sure. Can you explain why?
61	O’ROURKE	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	My goal is to ensure that every American is well enough to live to their full potential because they have health care. In Laredo, Texas, I met a young man, 27 years old, told me that he’d been to a doctor once in his life. And on that visit, he was told he had diabetes, he was told he had glaucoma, and he was told untreated — because he doesn’t have health care — he’ll be dead before the age of 40. So getting to guaranteed, high-quality, universal health care as quickly and surely as possible has to be our goal. The ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider, to be — the ability to see a mental health care provider. In Texas, the single largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system today. And health care also has to mean that every woman can make her own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible. Our plan says that if you’re uninsured, we enroll you in Medicare. If you’re insufficiently insured, you can’t afford your premiums, we enroll you in Medicare. But if you’re a member of a union that negotiated for a health care plan that you like because it works for you and your family, you’re able to keep it.
62	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Healthcare	Your time is up.
63	O’ROURKE	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	We preserve choice by making sure everybody has care.
64	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Healthcare	Your time is up, Congressman, but I do want to ask a follow-up on this. Just to be very clear — I’ll give you 10 seconds — would you replace private insurance?
65	O’ROURKE	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	No. I think the choice is fundamental to our ability to get everybody cared for…
66	De Blasio	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	BLASIO: Wait, wait, wait. Congressman O’Rourke, Congressman O’Rourke, private insurance is not working for tens of millions of Americans when you talk about the co-pays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out of pocket expenses. It’s not working. How can you defend a system that’s not working?
67	O’ROURKE	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	That’s right. So for those for whom it’s not working, they can choose Medicare. For the…
68	De Blasio	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	BLASIO: Congressman…
69	O’ROURKE	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	… who I listen to…
70	De Blasio	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	BLASIO: … you’ve got to start by acknowledging the system is not working for people.
71	O’ROURKE	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	… they’re able to keep them.
72	De Blasio	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	BLASIO: Why are you defending private insurance to begin with?
73	DELANEY	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	… 100 million Americans say they like their private health insurance, by the way. It should be noted that 100 million Americans — I mean, I think we should be the party that keeps what’s working and fixes what’s broken. I mean, doesn’t that make sense? I mean, we should give everyone in this country health care as a basic human right for free, full stop. But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance. Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people? And also it’s bad policy. If you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question, which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate? Every single hospital administrator said they would close. And the Medicare for all bill requires payments to stay at current Medicare rates. So to some extent, we’re supporting a bill that will have every hospital closing. I mean, my dad was a union electrician, right? I actually grew up in a working-class family. He loved the health care that the IBEW gave him. And I just always think about my dad in anything I would do from a policy perspective. He’d look at me and he’d say, good job, John, for getting health care for every American. But why are you taking my health care away?
74	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Healthcare	I’ve let this — I’ve let this play out a little bit because I’m fascinated to hear the daylight between you. Congresswoman Gabbard, why don’t you weigh in here?
75	GABBARD	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	I think we’re talking about this in the wrong way. You’re talking about one bill over another bill. Really, what we’re talking about is our objective, making sure that every single sick American in this country is able to get the health care that they need. I believe Medicare for all is the way to do that. I also think that employers will recognize how much money will be saved by supporting a Medicare for all program, a program that will reduce the administrative costs, reduce the bureaucratic costs, and make sure that everyone gets that quality health care that they need. I also think that…
76	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Healthcare	Senator…
77	GABBARD	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	… if you — if you look at other countries in the world who have universal health care, every one of them has some form of a role of private insurance, so I think that’s what we’ve got to look at, taking the best of these ideas, but making sure unequivocally that no sick American goes without getting the care that they need, regardless of how much or little money they have in their pocket.
78	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Healthcare	Congresswoman, Congresswoman, thanks.
79	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Healthcare	Let me turn to Senator Booker on this. Senator Booker, explain to me where you are. This is hugely important to people. So tell us where you are.
80	BOOKER	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	I absolutely will. First of all, we’re talking about this as a health care issue, but in communities like mine, low-income communities, it’s an education issue, because kids who don’t have health care are not going to succeed in school. It is an issue for jobs and employment, because people who do not have good health care do not succeed at work. It’s even a retirement issue, because in my community, African-Americans have a lower life expectancy because of poorer health care. And so where I stand is very clear. Health care — it’s not just a human right, it should be an American right. And I believe the best way to get there is Medicare for all. But I have an urgency about this. When I am president of the United States, I’m not going to wait. We have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care. And on this debate, I’m sorry. There are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America, from pharmaceutical companies to insurers. Literally, the overhead for insurance that they charge is 15 percent, while Medicare’s overhead is only at 2 percent. We can do this better. And every single day, I will be fighting to give people more access and more affordable costs until we get to my goal…
81	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Healthcare	Your time is up, Senator.
82	BOOKER	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	… which is every American having health care.
83	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Healthcare	Time is up, Senator. I want to…
84	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Healthcare	I want to move back, if I can, to Congresswoman Gabbard…
85	WARREN	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	… point, though, and that is that the insurance companies last year alone sucked $23 billion in profits out of the health care system, $23 billion. And that doesn’t count the money that was paid to executives, the money that was spent lobbying Washington. We have a giant industry that wants our health care system to stay the way it is, because it’s not working for families, but it’s sure as heck working for them.
87	INSLEE	Candidate	9.0	Abortion	It should not be an option in the United States of America for any insurance company to deny a woman coverage for their exercise of their right of choice. And I am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a woman’s right of reproductive health in health insurance, and I’m the only candidate who has passed a public option. And I respect everybody’s goals and plans here, but we do have one candidate that’s actually advanced the ball. And we’ve got to have access for everyone. I’ve done it as a public option.
88	HOLT	Moderator	9.0	Abortion	Your time…
89	HOLT	Moderator	9.0	Abortion	Senator Klobuchar, I want to get you…
90	(UNKNOWN)	Candidate	9.0	Abortion	That’s a false claim.
91	HOLT	Moderator	9.0	Abortion	I am fascinated by this. Senator — Senator Klobuchar?
92	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	9.0	Abortion	I just want to say, there’s three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a woman’s right to choose. I’ll start with that. And then I just want to make very clear, I think we share the goal of universal health care. And the idea I put out there, the public option, which the governor was just talking about, this idea is that you use Medicare or Medicaid without any insurance companies involved, you can do it either way. And the estimates are 13 million people would see a reduction in their premiums, 12 more million people would get covered. So I think it is a beginning and the way you start and the way you move to universal health care.
93	HOLT	Moderator	10.0	Abortion	Secretary Castro, this one is for you. All of you on stage support a woman’s right to an abortion. You all support some version of a government health care option. Would your plan cover abortion, Mr. Secretary?
94	CASTRO	Candidate	10.0	Abortion	Yes, it would. I don’t believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice. And, you know, what that means is that just because a woman — or let’s also not forget someone in the trans community, a trans female, is poor, doesn’t mean they shouldn’t have the right to exercise that right to choose. And so I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion. More than that, everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today, a person’s right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri, in Alabama, in Georgia. I would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of Roe v. Wade and will respect it.… and in addition to that, make sure that we fight hard as we transition our health care system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right.
95	HOLT	Moderator	10.0	Abortion	Senator Warren, would you put limits on — any limits on abortion?
96	WARREN	Candidate	10.0	Abortion	I would make certain that every woman has access to the full range of reproductive health care services, and that includes birth control, it includes abortion, it includes everything for a woman. And I want to add on that. It’s not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us. Forty-seven years ago, Roe v. Wade was decided, and we’ve all looked to the courts all that time, as state after state has undermined Roe, has put in exceptions, has come right up to the edge of taking away protections.
97	HOLT	Moderator	10.0	Abortion	Your time is up, Senator.
100	BOOKER	Candidate	11.0	Opiod Crisis	They should absolutely be held criminally liable, because they are liable and responsible. This is one of the reasons why well before I was running for president I said I would not take contributions from pharma companies, not take contributions from corporate PACs, or pharma executives, because they are part of this problem. And this opioid addiction in our country, we in cities like mine have been seeing how we’ve tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long. It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that.
101	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	11.0	Opiod Crisis	Congressman O’Rourke, how would you deal with it?
102	O’ROURKE	Candidate	11.0	Opiod Crisis	Tonight in this country, you have 2.3 million of our fellow Americans behind bars. It’s the largest prison population on the face of the planet. Many are there for nonviolent drug crimes, including possession of marijuana, at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized it. And yet despite what Purdue Pharma has done, their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we’re seeing throughout this country, they’ve been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences, not a single night in jail. Unless there’s accountability and justice, this crisis will continue. In my administration, we will hold them to account. We will make sure that they pay a price, and we will help those who’ve been victims of this malfeasance in this country get them treatment and long-term care.
105	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Thank you very much, Jose. I’m very proud that in April I became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan. And we saw those images… … watching that image of Oscar and his daughter, Valeria, is heartbreaking. It should also piss us all off. If I were president today — and it should spur us to action. If I were president today, I would sign an executive order that would get rid of Trump’s zero-tolerance policy, the remain in Mexico policy, and the metering policy — this metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river. They had been playing games with people who are coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry. Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry, and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim, so they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river, and they died because of that.
106	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	On day one. Sorry, I’m just going to ask…
107	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	On day one, I would do that executive order that would address metering. And then I would follow that up in my first 100 days with immigration reform that would honor asylum claims, that would put undocumented immigrants, as long as they haven’t committed a serious crime, on a pathway to citizenship. And then we’d get to the root cause of the issue, which is we need a Marshall Plan for Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of coming to the United States to seek it.
108	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Senator Booker, what would you do on day one? And this is a situation that the next president will inherit.
109	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Senator Booker, what would you do on day one? And this is a situation that the next president will inherit.
110	BOOKER	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Yes. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) On day one, I will make sure that, number one, we end the ICE policies and the Customs and Border Policies that are violating the human rights. When people come to this country, they do not leave their human rights at the border. Number two…I will make sure that we reinstate DACA, that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for DACA recipients, and to make sure that people that are here on temporary protective status can stay and remain here. And then, finally, we need to make sure that we address the issues that made Oscar and Valeria come in the first place, by making major investments in the Northern Triangle, not like this president is doing, by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem. We cannot surrender our values and think that we’re going to get border security. We actually will lose security and our values. We must fight for both.
111	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	… if I might — if I might, very briefly, and this is an important point. You know, my plan — and I’m glad to see that Senator Booker, Senator Warren, and Governor Inslee agree with me on this. My plan also includes getting rid of Section 1325 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, to go back to the way we used to treat this when somebody comes across the border, not to criminalize desperation, to treat that as a civil violation. And here’s why it’s important. We see all of this horrendous family separation. They use that law, Section 1325, to justify under the law separating little children from their families.
112	(UNKNOWN)	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Thank you.
113	(UNKNOWN)	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Jose…
114	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	And so I want to challenge every single candidate on this stage to support the repeal of Section 1325.
115	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Thirty seconds.
116	BOOKER	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	As my friend here said, I agree with him on that issue, but folks should understand that the separation of children from families doesn’t just go on at our border. It happens in our communities, as ICE are ripping away parents from their American children, spouses and the like, and are creating fear in cities all across this country where parents are afraid to even drop their kids off to school or go to work. We must end those policies, as well.
117	De Blasio	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	BLASIO: We have to change the discussion about in this country…
118	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Mayor?
119	De Blasio	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	BLASIO: … because look at the bottom line here. Those tragic — that tragic photo of those — that parent, that child — and I’m saying this as a father. Every American should feel that in their heart, every American should say that is not America, those are not our values. But we have to get under the skin of why we have this crisis in our system, because we’re not being honest about the division that’s been fomented in this country. The way that American citizens have been told that immigrants somehow created their misery and their pain and their challenges, for all the American citizens out there who feel you’re falling behind or feel the American dream is not working for you, the immigrants didn’t do that to you. The big corporations did that to you. The 1 percent did that to you. We need to be the party of working people, and that includes a party of immigrants. But first we have to tell working people in America who are hurting that we’re going to be on their side every single time against those big corporations who created this mess to begin with. And remind people we’re all in this together. If we don’t change that debate, that politics that’s holding us back, we won’t get all these reforms people are talking about. That’s what we need to do as Democrats.
120	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	If I could, I’m sorry. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) What would you do, Congressman, day one at the White House??
121	O’ROURKE	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) We would not turn back Valeria and her father, Oscar. We would accept them into this country and follow our own asylum laws. We would not build walls. We would not put kids in cages. In fact, we would spare no expense to reunite the families that have been separated already…
122	O’ROURKE	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	… and we would not criminally prosecute any family who is fleeing violence and persecution…
123	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	… repeal of Section 1325.
124	O’ROURKE	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	We would make sure…
125	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Secretary, let him finish. And I will give you…
126	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	But let him finish. Let him finish.
127	O’ROURKE	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	We would not detain any family fleeing violence, in fact, fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet today. We would implement a family case management program so they could be cared for in the community at a fraction of the cost. And then we would rewrite our immigration laws in our own image, free Dreamers forever from any fear of deportation by making them U.S. citizens here in this country, invest in solutions in Central America, work with regional stakeholders so there’s no reason to make that 2,000 mile journey to this country.
128	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Thank you. Secretary, I’ll give you 30 seconds.
129	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Let’s be very clear. The reason that they’re separating these little children from their families is that they’re using Section 1325 of that act which criminalizes coming across the border to incarcerate the parents and then separate them. Some of us on this stage have called to end that section, to terminate it. Some, like Congressman O’Rourke, have not. And I want to challenge all of the candidate to do that.
130	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	I just think it’s a mistake, Beto. I think it’s a mistake. And I think that — that if you truly want to change the system, that we’ve got to repeal that section. If not…
131	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Thank you.
132	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	… then it might as well be the same policy.
133	O’ROURKE	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Let me respond to this very briefly. As a member of a Congress, I helped to introduce legislation that would ensure that we don’t criminalize those who are seeking asylum and refuge in this country.
134	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	I’m not talking about — I’m not talking about the ones that are seeking asylum.
135	O’ROURKE	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	If you’re fleeing — if you’re fleeing desperation, then I want to make sure…
136	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	I’m talking about — I’m talking about everybody else.
137	O’ROURKE	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	… I want to make sure you are treated with respect.
138	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	I’m still talking about everybody else.
139	O’ROURKE	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	But you’re looking at just one small part of this. I’m talking about a comprehensive rewrite of our immigration laws.
140	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	That’s not true.
141	O’ROURKE	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	And if you do that, I don’t think it’s asking too much for people to follow our laws when they come to this country.
142	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	That’s actually not true. I’m talking about millions of folks — a lot of folks that are coming are not seeking asylum. A lot of them are undocumented immigrants, right? And you said recently that the reason you didn’t want to repeal Section 1325 was because you were concerned about human trafficking and drug trafficking. But let me tell you what: Section 18, title 18 of the U.S. code, title 21 and title 22, already cover human trafficking.
143	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	I think that you should do your homework on this issue. If you did your homework on this issue, you would know that we should repeal this section.
144	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	This is an issue that we should and could be talking about for a long time, and we will for a long time.
145	DELANEY	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Can we talk about the conditions about why people are coming here?
146	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Let’s — Lester — Lester — I’m sorry, Savannah — I know, it’s just — we could go on.
147	DELANEY	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	But rather than talk about specific provisions, we really have to talk about why these people are coming to our country…
148	GUTHRIE	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	You’ll get your chance.
149	DELANEY	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	… and what we’re going to do to actually make a difference in these countries.
150	GUTHRIE	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Congressman, you’ll get your chance. Let’s continue the discussion. Senator Klobuchar…
151	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Yes.
152	GUTHRIE	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Let’s talk about what Secretary Castro just said. He wants to no longer have it be a crime to illegally cross the border. Do you support that? Do you think it should be a civil offense only? And if so, do you worry about potentially incentivizing people to come here?
153	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Immigrants, they do not diminish America. They are America. And I am happy to look at his proposal. But I do think you want to make sure that you have provisions in place that allow you to go after traffickers and allow you to go after people who are violating the law. What I really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here. And that is that 70 of our Fortune 500 companies are headed by people that came from other countries. Twenty-five percent of our U.S. Nobel laureates were born in other countries. We have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories. We need them to start small businesses. We need their ideas. And this president has literally gone backwards at a time when our economy needs immigrants. And so my proposal is to look at that 2013 bill that passed the Senate with Republican support, to upgrade that bill, to make it as good as possible and get it done. It brings the doubt down by $158 billion.
154	GUTHRIE	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Senator…
155	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	It gives a path for citizenship for citizen — for people who can become citizens. And it will be so much better for our economy in America.
156	GUTHRIE	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Senator, that’s time. Thank you. Congressman Ryan, same question. Should it be a crime to illegally cross the border? Or should it be a civil offense only?
157	RYAN	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Well, I agree with Secretary Castro. I think there are other provisions in the law that will allow you to prosecute people for coming over here if they’re dealing drugs and other things. That’s already established in the law. So there’s no need to repeat it. And I think it’s abhorrent — we’re talking about this father who got killed with his daughter, and the issues here — the way these kids are being treated. If you go to Guantanamo Bay, there are terrorists that are held that get better health care than those kids that have tried to cross the border in the United States. That needs to stop. And I think the president should immediately ask doctors and nurses to go immediately down to the border and start taking care of these kids. What kind of country are we running here where we have a president of the United States who’s so focused on hate and fear and division? And what has happened now, the end result is now we’ve got kids literally laying in their own snot, with three-week-old diapers that haven’t been changed. We’ve got to tell this president that is not a sign of strength, Mr. President. That is a sign of weakness.
158	GUTHRIE	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Senator Booker — a lot of people — they asked the question, if you’re president on day one, what will you do with the fact that you will have families here? There’s been a lot of talk about what you’ll do in the first 100 days about legislation. What will you actually do with these families? How will you care for them? Will they be detained or will they not be?
159	BOOKER	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Well, this is a related and brief point, because what we’re talking — what Secretary Castro and I are talking about is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process. I have been to some of the largest private prisons, which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration, and their immigration lockups. Our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things, whether it’s immigration, whether it’s mental illness, whether it’s addiction. We know that this is not the way to deal with problems. There is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solves this problem. Donald Trump isn’t solving this problem. We’ve seen under his leadership a surge at our border. We solve this problem by making investments in the Northern Triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place, and we make sure we use our resources to provide health care to affirm the values and human dignity of the people that come here, because we cannot sacrifice our values, our ideals as a nation for border security. We can have both by doing this the right way.
160	GUTHRIE	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	All right, Senator, thank you. Let me go to Governor Inslee on this. What would you do on day one? Same question I just asked Cory Booker. I have yet to hear an answer from anyone on this stage.
161	INSLEE	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	There is no reason…
162	GUTHRIE	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	What will you do with the families that will be here?
163	INSLEE	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	There is no reason for the detention and separation of these children. They should be released, pending their hearings, and they should have a hearing and the law should be followed. That’s what should happen. And we should do what we’re doing in Washington state. I’m proud that we’ve passed a law that prevents local law enforcement from being turned into mini-ICE agents. I’m proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump’s heinous Muslim ban. I’m proud to be a person who’s not only talked about Dreamers, but being one of the first to make sure that they get a college education, so that they can realize their dreams. These are some of the most inspirational people in our state. And I’ll leave you with this thought, if you want to know what I think. Donald Trump the other day tried to threaten me — he thought it was a threat — to tell me that he would send refugees into Washington state if we passed a law that I passed. And I told him that’s not a threat at all. We welcome refugees into our state. We recognize diversity as a strength. This is how we’ve built America. That tradition is going to continue if I’m president of the United States.
164	HOLT	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	We’re going to switch to another topic now. We’ve got a lot to get to. Let’s…
167	BOOKER	Candidate	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	May I address that? First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal. And one of the reasons why we’re seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation. Literally, he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years. And now we see Iran threatening to go further and who are pulled — being pulled further and further into this crisis. We need to renegotiate and get back into a deal, but I’m not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally I’m going to rejoin that deal. Because when I’m president of the United States, I’m going to do the best I can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if I have an opportunity to leverage a better deal, I’m going to do it.
168	HOLT	Moderator	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	All right, Senator Klobuchar, I’d like to ask you to answer that question, because you’ve said — you’ve said you would negotiate yourself back into the Iranian agreement. Can you argue that that nuclear pact as it was ratified was a good deal?
169	(UNKNOWN)	Candidate	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	Yes, it was.
170	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	It was imperfect, but it was a good deal for that moment. I would have worked to get longer sunset periods, and that’s something we could negotiate, to get back in the deal. But the point is, Donald Trump told us when he got out of it that he was going to give us a better deal. Those were his words. And now we are a month away from the Iranians, who claim now that they’re going blow the caps on enriching uranium. And the Iranians have told us this. And so that’s where we are now. He has made us less safe than we were when he became president. So what I would do is negotiate us back into that agreement, is stand with our allies, and not give unlimited leverage to China and Russia, which is what he has done. And then, finally, I would make sure that if there is any possibility of a conflict — and we’re having this debate in Congress right now — that he comes to Congress for an authorization of military force. I would do that. And this president is literally every single day 10 minutes away from going to war, one tweet away from going to war. And I don’t think we should conduct…
171	HOLT	Moderator	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	All right, your time is up.
172	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	… foreign policy in our bathrobe at 5:00 in the morning, which is what he does.
173	HOLT	Moderator	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	Congresswoman Gabbard, Congresswoman Gabbard, you’ve said you would sign back on to the 2015 deal. Would you — would you insist, though, that it address Iran’s support for Hezbollah?
174	GABBARD	Candidate	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	Let’s deal with the situation where we are, where this president and his chickenhawk cabinet have led us to the brink of war with Iran. I served in the war in Iraq at the height of the war in 2005, a war that took over 4,000 of my brothers and sisters in uniforms’ lives. The American people need to understand that this war with Iran would be far more devastating, far more costly than anything that we ever saw in Iraq. It would take many more lives. It would exacerbate the refugee crisis. And it wouldn’t be just contained within Iran. This would turn into a regional war. This is why it’s so important that every one of us, every single American, stand up and say no war with Iran. We need to get back into the Iran nuclear agreement, and we need to negotiate how we can improve it. It was an imperfect deal. There are issues, like their missile development, that needs to be addressed. We can do both simultaneously to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and preventing us from going to war.
175	HOLT	Moderator	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	Your time is up. And this is a very quick follow-up. But what would your red line be that would — for military action against Iran?
176	GABBARD	Candidate	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	Look, obviously, if there was an attack against the American — our troops, then there would have to be a response. But my point is — and it’s important for us to recognize this — is Donald Trump and his cabinet, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and others — are creating a situation that just a spark would light off a war with Iran, which is incredibly dangerous. That’s why we need to de-escalate tensions. Trump needs to get back into the Iran nuclear deal and swallow his pride, put the American people first.
177	De Blasio	Candidate	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	BLASIO: Hey, but wait a minute…
226	BOOKER	Candidate	16.0	Supreme Court Nominees	I’m going to use 20 of my seconds just to say there’s one thing we don’t all agree with when it comes to guns, and I think it’s common sense, and over 70 percent of Americans agree with me. If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to buy and own a firearm. And not everybody in this field agrees with that. But in states like Connecticut that did that, they saw 40 percent drops in gun violence and 15 percent drops in suicides. We need to start having bold agendas on guns. When it comes to the Supreme Court, very clearly, we — I agree with my friend, Secretary Castro. We are going to get to 50 votes in the Senate. This is a team sport. Whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like South Carolina, because we can elect Jamie Harrison. They need to campaign in places like Iowa, because we can win a Senate seat there. This is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the Senate and more so that we cannot only balance the Supreme Court, but start to pass an aggressive agenda that, frankly, isn’t so aggressive, because most of America agrees with the policy objectives of our party.
227	MADDOW	Moderator	16.0	Supreme Court Nominees	Mayor De Blasio…
228	DELANEY	Candidate	16.0	Supreme Court Nominees	Rachel, we have to actually…
229	MADDOW	Moderator	16.0	Supreme Court Nominees	Congressman Delaney, you’ll have some time in a moment on this issue.
230	DELANEY	Candidate	16.0	Supreme Court Nominees	This issue is related…
231	MADDOW	Moderator	16.0	Supreme Court Nominees	Congressman Delaney, I’ll give you some time in a moment. Mayor De Blasio, as an executive in the largest city in this country, you are used to saying what you want to have happen and having it happen. If you nominate a Supreme Court nominee as president of the United States and Mitch McConnell is still Senate majority leader, what makes you believe that he would allow you to make a nominee?
232	De Blasio	Candidate	16.0	Supreme Court Nominees	BLASIO: Rachel, I am chief executive of the nation’s largest city, and I also wanted to just say something quick on the gun issue and come to your question. Look, I run the largest police force in America, too, and if we’re going to stop these shootings, we want to get these guns off the street, we have to have a very different relationship between our police and our community. I also want to say there’s something that sets me apart from all my colleagues running in this race, and that is, for the last 21 years, I have been raising a black son in America. And I have had to have very, very serious talks with my son, Dante, about how to protect himself on the streets of our city and all over this country, including how to deal with the fact that he has to take special caution because there have been too many tragedies between our young men and our police, too, as we saw recently in Indiana. So we need to have a different conversation in this country about guns, but also a different conversation about policing that brings policing community together. We’ve done that in New York City and we’ve driven down crime while we’ve done it. But to your question about Mitch McConnell, there is a political solution that we have to come to grips with. If the Democratic Party would stop acting like the party of the elites and be the party of working people again, and go into states, including red states, to convince people we’re on their side, we can put pressure on their senators to actually have to vote for the nominees that are put forward…
281	GABBARD	Candidate	19.0	LGBTQ	Let me say that there is no one in our government at any level who has the right to tell any American who they should be allowed to love or who they should be allowed to marry. My record in Congress for over six years shows my commitment to fighting for LGBTQ equality. I serve on the Equality Caucus and recently voted for passage of the Equality Act. Maybe many people in this country can relate to the fact that I grew up in a socially conservative home, held views when I was very young that I no longer hold today. I’ve served with LGBTQ servicemembers, both in training and deployed downrange. I know that they would give their life for me and I would give my life for them. It is this commitment that I’ll carry through as president of the United States, recognizing that there are still people who are facing discrimination in the workplace, still people who are unable to find a home for their families. It is this kind of discrimination that we need to address.
282	BOOKER	Candidate	19.0	LGBTQ	But it’s not enough.
283	TODD	Moderator	19.0	LGBTQ	Thank you, Congresswoman Gabbard.
284	BOOKER	Candidate	19.0	LGBTQ	It’s not enough. If I can add to this, it’s very important.
285	TODD	Moderator	19.0	LGBTQ	Thirty seconds, Senator.
286	BOOKER	Candidate	19.0	LGBTQ	It’s not enough. Look, civil rights is someplace to begin, but in the African American civil rights community, another place to focus on was to stop the lynching of African-Americans. We do not talk enough about trans Americans, especially African-American trans Americans… … and the incredibly high rates of murder right now. We don’t talk enough about how many children, about 30 percent of LGBTQ kids, who do not go to school because of fear. It’s not enough just to be on the Equality Act. I’m an original co-sponsor. We need to have a president that will fight to protect LGBTQ Americans every single day from violence in America.
287	MADDOW	Moderator	19.0	LGBTQ	Senator Klobuchar, let me put this to you. On the issue of civil rights, for decades — on the civil rights and demographics, honestly, and politics, for decades, the Democratic Party has counted on African-American voter turnout as step one to winning elections on a national level. Democrats are counting on the Latino community now and in the future in the same way. What have you done for black and Latino voters that should enthuse them about going to the polls for you if you’re your party’s nominee?
288	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	19.0	LGBTQ	My life and my career and my work in the Senate has been about economic opportunity. And to me, this means better childcare for everyone in this country. And when you want an economy that works, you need to have retirement that works, you need to have public schools that work. And you also need to make sure that those communities are able to get those jobs of the future, the STEM jobs. In fact, Donald Trump, one of the first bills that he signed of the 34 he signed where I was the lead Democrat — OK, that’s a first up here — was one that was about that, making sure minority community members could share in those jobs. So to me, this is about a few things. It’s about an African-American woman that goes to a hospital in New Orleans, says her hands are swollen, and then doctor ignores her and her baby dies. It’s about the fact that African-American women make 61 cents for every dollar a white man makes. So in short, we need, one — and I will do this in my first 100 days as president — we will work to make sure everyone can vote at this table, everyone can vote in this country…
289	MADDOW	Moderator	19.0	LGBTQ	That’s time, Senator.
290	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	19.0	LGBTQ	… and we will also go to the next step of criminal justice reform. Senator Booker and I worked on that First Step Act, but we should go to the second step act, which is to help all our communities across our country.
291	MADDOW	Moderator	19.0	LGBTQ	Senator, thank you very much. Thirty-second follow-up to you, Secretary Castro. This is a 70 percent Latino city here in Miami. You are the only Latino Democrat who is running here this year in the presidential race. Is that enough of an answer, what Senator Klobuchar is describing there, an economic justice agenda? Is that enough to mobilize Latino voters to stand with the Democratic Party in a big way?
292	CASTRO	Candidate	19.0	LGBTQ	Well, I also think that we have to recognize racial and social justice. And, you know, I was in Charleston not too long ago, and I remembered that Dylann Roof went to the Mother Emanuel AME church, and he murdered nine people who were worshipping, and then he was apprehended by police without incident. Well, but what about Eric Garner and Tamir Rice and Laquan McDonald and Sandra Bland and Pamela Turner and Antonio Arce? I’m proud that I’m the only candidate so far that has put forward legislation that would reform our policing system in America and make sure that no matter what the color of your skin is, that you’re treated the same, including Latinos who are mistreated too oftentimes by police.
296	O’ROURKE	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	John, appreciate the question. The answer is yes, but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends. When the United States presents a united front, we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer, the kind of genocide that we saw in Rwanda, the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward. But unfortunately, under this administration, President Trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances. He’s diminished our standing in the world and he’s made us weaker as a country, less able to confront challenges, whether it’s Iran or North Korea or Vladimir Putin in Russia, who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016, and who President Trump has offered another invitation to do the same. He’s embraced strongmen and dictators at the expense of the great democracies. As president, I will make sure that we live our values in our foreign policy. I will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together. That makes America stronger.
297	De Blasio	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	BLASIO: But what about the War Powers Act?
298	MADDOW	Moderator	20.0	Foreign Policy	Congressman O’Rourke, thank you.
299	De Blasio	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	BLASIO: What about the War Powers Act being a part of that equation? With deep respect to the congressman, look, we’ve learned painful lessons as Americans that we’ve gone to war without congressional authorization. And look, this is very personal for me. I know the cost of war. My dad served in the Pacific in World War II in the U.S. Army, Battle of Okinawa, had half his leg blown off, and he came home with scars, both physical and emotional, and he did not recover. He spiraled downward and he ultimately took his own life. And that battle didn’t kill him, but that war did. And, look, even in the humanitarian crisis — and I think we should be ready, Congressman, to intervene, God forbid there is genocide — but not without congressional approval. Democrats and Republicans both in the Congress have not challenged presidents and have let them get away with running the military without that congressional approval. We learned a lesson in Vietnam we seem to have forgotten, that decisions have to be made by the United States Congress…
300	MADDOW	Moderator	20.0	Foreign Policy	I’m going to pick up — I want to pick up this point, and I want to put this to Congressman Ryan. Today the Taliban claimed responsibility for killing two American servicemembers in Afghanistan. Leaders as disparate as President Obama and President Trump have both said that they want to end U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, but it isn’t over for America. Why isn’t it over? Why can’t presidents of very different parties and very different temperaments get us out of there? And how could you?
301	RYAN	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	I appreciate that question. So I’ve been in Congress 17 years. And 12 of those years I’ve sat on the Armed Services Committee, the Defense Appropriations Committee or the Armed Services Committee. And the lesson that I’ve learned over the years is that you have to stay engaged in these situations. Nobody likes it. It’s long. It’s tedious. But right now, we have — so I would say we must be engaged in this. We must have our State Department engaged. We must have our military engaged to the extent they need to be. But the reality of it is, this president doesn’t even have people appointed in the State Department to deal with these things, whether we’re talking about Central America, whether we’re talking about Iran, whether we’re talking about Afghanistan. We’ve got to be completely engaged. And here’s why, because these flare-ups distract us from the real problems in the country. If we’re getting drones shot down for $130 million, because the president is distracted, that’s $130 million that we could be spending in places like Youngstown, Ohio, or Flint, Michigan, or rebuilding — or rebuilding…
302	MADDOW	Moderator	20.0	Foreign Policy	Congresswoman Gabbard, I’m going to give you 30 seconds, actually, to jump off what he said. He described engagement as the problem.
303	GABBARD	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	Is that what you will tell — is that what you will tell the parents of those two soldiers who were just killed in Afghanistan? Well, we just have to be engaged? As a soldier, I will tell you, that answer is unacceptable. We have to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. We are in a place in Afghanistan where we have lost so many lives. We’ve spent so much money. Money that’s coming out of every one of our pockets, money that should be going into communities here at home, meeting the needs of the people here at home. We are no better off in Afghanistan today than we were when this war began. This is why it’s so important to have a president and commander-in-chief who knows the cost of war and who’s ready to do the job on day one. I am ready to do that job when I walk into the Oval Office.
304	TODD	Moderator	20.0	Foreign Policy	Listen, I’m going to go down the line — I’m going to go down — I’m going to go down — I’m going to go down the line here. You know what, you felt — you felt like she was rebutting you. Get 30 seconds, go.
305	RYAN	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	Thank you. You’re a very good man. I appreciate that.
306	TODD	Moderator	20.0	Foreign Policy	Fair enough. I hear what you’re saying. She invoked your name.
307	RYAN	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	I would just say, I don’t want to be engaged. I wish we were spending this money in places that I’ve represented that have been completely forgotten and we were rebuilding. But the reality of it is, if the United States isn’t engaged, the Taliban will grow. And they will have bigger, bolder terrorist acts. We have got to have some presence there…
308	GABBARD	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	The Taliban was there long before we came in. They’re going to be there long before we leave.
309	RYAN	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	And they were — yeah, exactly. Well, we were.
310	GABBARD	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	We cannot keep U.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan thinking that we’re going to somehow squash this Taliban that’s been there, that every other country that’s tried has failed.
311	RYAN	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	I didn’t say — I didn’t say squash them. I didn’t say squash them. When we weren’t in there, they started flying planes into our buildings. So I’m just saying right now … we have an obligation…
312	GABBARD	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	The Taliban didn’t attack us on 9/11. Al Qaida did.
313	RYAN	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	Well, I — I understand…
314	GABBARD	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	Al Qaida attacked us on 9/11. That’s why I and so many other people joined the military, to go after Al Qaida, not the Taliban.
315	RYAN	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	I understand that. The Taliban…
316	TODD	Moderator	20.0	Foreign Policy	Go ahead, Congressman. Finish up, 10 seconds.
317	RYAN	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	The Taliban was protecting those people who were plotting against us. All I’m saying is, if we want to go into elections, and we want to say that we’ve got to withdraw from the world, that’s what President Trump is saying. We can’t. I would love for us to.
410	SANDERS	Candidate		Opening statements	Well, you are quite right. We have a new vision for America and at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America, while 500,000 people are sleeping out on the streets today we think it is time for change, real change. And by that I mean that healthcare in my view is a human right and we have got to pass a Medicare for all single-payer system. Under that system by the way vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now. I believe that education is the future for this country and that is why I believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition-free and eliminate student debt and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street. Every proposal that I have brought forth is fully paid for.
411	GUTHRIE	Moderator		Opening statements	Senator Sanders I will give you 10 seconds just to ask the–answer the very direct question will you raise taxes for the middle class in a Sanders administration?
412	SANDERS	Candidate		Opening statements	People who have healthcare under Medicare for all will have no premiums, no deductibles, no copayments, no out of expe–out-of-pocket expenses. Yes, they will pay more in taxes but less in healthcare for what they get.
413	GUTHRIE	Moderator		Opening statements	Thank you Senator.
414	BENNET	Candidate		Opening statements	Senator Sanders–
415	GUTHRIE	Moderator		Opening statements	Senator–Senator Bennet we’re going to get to everybody.
418	BIDEN	Candidate		Biden addresses income inequality	What I meant by that is look, Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America. Ordinary middle-class Americans built America. My dad used to have an expression he said Joe a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it’s about your dignity, it’s about respect, it’s being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything’s going to be okay. Too many people who are in the middle class and poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal. What I am saying is that we’ve got to be straightforward. We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it. They have to make sure that we (INAUDIBLE) situation where there’s continuing education and they are able to pay for it and they have to make sure that they are able to breathe air that is–is–is clean and they–they have water that they can drink. Look, Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation. We do have enormous income inequality and one thing I agree honestly can make massive cuts in the $1.6 trillion in tax loopholes out there and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy.
423	HICKENLOOPER	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Well, I think that the bottom line is, if we don’t clearly define that we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way they can and–and call us socialists. And if you look at the Green New Deal, which I admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change, I’m a scientist, but we can’t promise every American a government job if you want to get universal healthcare coverage. I believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege, but you can’t expect to eliminate private insurance for 180 million people, many of whom don’t want to give it up. In Colorado, we brought businesses and nonprofits together. We got to near universal healthcare coverage. We were the first state in America to–to bring the environmental community and the oil and gas industry to address, aggressively address methane emissions. And we were also the first place to–to expand reproductive rights on a scale basis that we reduced teen pregnancy by 54 percent. We’ve done the big progressive things people said it couldn’t be done. I’ve done what pretty much everyone else up here is still talking about doing.
424	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Governor, thank you. Senator Sanders–I’ll give you a chance to–to weigh in here. What is your response to those who say nominating a–a socialist would reelect Donald Trump?
425	SANDERS	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Well, I think the responses at the polls, last poll I saw had us 10 points ahead of Donald Trump, because the American people understand that Trump is a phony, that Trump is a pathological liar and a racist, and then he lied to the American people during his campaign. He said he was going to stand up for working families. Well, President Trump, you’re not standing up for working families when you try to throw 32 million people off the healthcare that they have and that 83 percent of your tax benefits go to the top 1 percent. That’s how we be Trump. We expose him for the fraud that he is.
426	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	In answer–
427	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Senator–
428	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–I want to talk about–
429	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Senator Gillibrand, 30 seconds.
430	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	I disagree with both their perspectives. The debate we’re having in our party right now is confusing because the truth is there’s a big difference between capitalism on the one hand and greed on the other. And so, all the things that we’re trying to change is when companies care more about profits when they do about people. So, if you’re talking about ending gun violence, it’s the greed of the NRA and the gun manufacturers that make any progress impossible. It’s the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies when we want to try to get healthcare as a right and not a privilege.
431	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Senator Gillibrand–
432	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–So, there may–
433	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Thank you–
434	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Not be disagreement in the party because, in truth, we want healthy capitalism.
435	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Senator, thank you.
436	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We don’t want corrupted capitalism–
437	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Thank you. I want to be fair to all the candidates–
438	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Which is the definition of greed.
439	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Thank you. Senator Bennet–You have said, “It’s possible to write policy proposals that have no basis in reality. You might as well call them candy.” Were you referring to any candidate or proposal in particular when you said that?
440	BENNET	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Are you–was that directed to me?
441	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Yes, that was your quote.
442	BENNET	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Well, thank you. That sounded like me. Thank you.
443	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	It was you.
444	BENNET	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	I appreciate it. Well–
445	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–It definitely wasn’t me–
446	BENNET	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Look, first of all, I agree completely with Bernie about what the fundamental challenge we’re facing as a country is, 40 years of no economic growth for 90 percent of the American people. One hundred and sixty thousand families in the top .1 percent have the same wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and we got the worst income inequality that we’ve had in 100 years. Where I disagree is on his solution on Medicare for All. You know, I–I have proposed getting to universal healthcare, which we need to do. It is a right. Healthcare is a right.
447	BENNET	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We need to get to personal healthcare. I believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with Obamacare and creating a public option that every family and every person in America can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option which for them would be like having Medicare for all or whether they want to keep their private insurance. I believe we will get there much more quickly if we do that.
448	BENNET	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	If I could just finish–Bernie mentioned that the taxes that we would have to pay because of those taxes Vermont rejected Medicare for all.
449	BENNET	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	In Bernie’s bill, in Bernie’s bill I wrote–
450	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We are going to talk about healthcare at length Senator, but at the moment my colleague–
451	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	In Senator Sanders’ bill I wrote the part in Senator Sanders’ bill that is the transition that merges what the two senators said.
452	HOLT	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Senator.
453	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	The truth is if you have a buy in over a four or five year period you move us to single payer more quickly.
454	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	BALART: Senator, we will get to this. We will get to this.
460	SWALWELL	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	I got $100,000 in student loan debt myself. I tell you–if I count on the people who have been in government for the past 30 years who were around when this problem was created to be the ones to solve it it is going to be the next generation, the 40 million of us who can’t start a family. Can’t take a good idea and start a business and can’t buy our first home. This is the generation that’s going to be able to solve student loan debt. This generation is ready to lead.
461	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	BALART: Mr.–Mr. Yang your signature policy is to give every adult in the United States $1,000 a month no questions asked.
462	YANG	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	That’s right.
463	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	BALART: I think that’s like $3.2 trillion a–a year. How would you do that?
464	YANG	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	I’m sorry?
465	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	BALART: Oh, so it’s difficult to do if you have companies like Amazon, trillion dollar tech companies paying literally 0 in taxes while they’re closing 30 percent of our stores. Now, we need to put the American people in a position to benefit from all of these innovations in other parts of the economy. And if we had a value added tax at even half the European level it would generate over 800 billion in new revenue which combined with the money in our hands it would be the trickle up economy from our people, families and communities up we would spend the money and circulate through our regional economies and neighborhoods–creating millions of jobs, making our families stronger and healthier. We’d save money on things like incarceration, homelessness services, emergency room healthcare and just the value gains from having a stronger, healthier, mentally healthier population would increase GDP by $700 billion. This is the move we have to make particularly as technology is now automating away millions of American’s jobs, why Donald Trump is our president today that we automated away 400 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and we’re about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs, call center jobs, fast food jobs, truck driving jobs on and on throughout the economy.
466	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	BALART: So, I get to understand you a little better. So, you’re saying $1,000 a month for everyone over 18 but a value added tax so you can spend that $1000 on value added tax?
467	YANG	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Well, the value added tax what it would end up–you would still be increasing the buying power of the bottom 94 percent of Americans. You have to spend a lot of money for a mild value add tax to eat up $12,000 a year per individual. So for the average family with two or three adults it would $24 to $36,000 a year.
468	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	BALART: OK. So, Congressman Swalwell, want to talk a little bit about what Mr. Yang is talking about and you just actually mentioned it–many Americans are worried about things like self-driving cars, robots, drones, artificial intelligence will cost them their jobs. What would you to help people get the skills they need to adapt to this new world?
469	SWALWELL	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	We must always be a country where technology creates more jobs than–
470	SWALWELL	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	–Displaces. And I’ve seen the anxiety across America where the manufacturing floors go from 1,000 to 100 to one. So, we have to modernize our schools, value the teachers who prepare our kids, wipe the student debt from any teacher that goes into a community that needs it. Invest in America’s communities, especially where places where the best exports are people who move away to get skills. But, Jose, I was six years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic Convention and said, it’s time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans. That candidate was then Senator Joe Biden. Joe Biden was right when he said it was time the pass the torch to a new generation of Americans 32 years ago. He’s still right today. If we’re going to solve the issues of automation (PH), pass the torch. If we’re going to solve the issues of climate chaos, pass the torch. If we’re going to solve the issue of student loan debt, pass the torch. If we’re going to end gun violence for families who are fearful of sending their kids to school, pass the torch.
471	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Vice president, would you like to sing a torch song?
472	BIDEN	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	I would. I’m still holding on to that torch. I want to make it clear to you, look, the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on to educate for an education. The fact is that that’s why I propose us focusing on schools that are in distress. That’s why I think we should triple the amount of money we spend for Title I schools. That’s why I think we should have universal Pre-K. That’s why I think every single person who graduates from high school–65 out of 100 now need something beyond high school and we should provide for them to be able to get that education. That’s why there should be free community college, cutting in half the cost of college. That’s why we should be in the position where we do not have anyone have to pay back the student debt when they get out, they’re making less than $25,000 a year. Their debt is frozen. No interest payment until they get beyond that. We can’t put people in a position where they aren’t able to go on and move on. And so, folks, there’s a lot we can do, but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the 21st century. We’re not doing that now.
473	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Senator. Senator.
474	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	As the youngest–as the youngest guy on the stage, I feel like I probably ought to contribute to the generation.

491	(UNKNOWN)	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	(INAUDIBLE) comment–
492	SANDERS	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	–To take on Wall Street, to take on the fossil fuel industry, to take on the big money interest who have unbelievable influence over the economic and political life of this country.
493	SWALWELL	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	These issues (INAUDIBLE).
494	SANDERS	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	That’s the issue.
495	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Senator Harris. Senator Harris.
496	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Senator Harris, I’m so sorry.
497	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Can I have a turn?
498	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	We will let all of these things. Senator Harris. We will let you all speak. Senator Harris.
499	(UNKNOWN)	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	been part of the issue–
501	HARRIS	Candidate	6.0	Sen. Harris’ ‘food fight’ moment	Hey, guys. You know what? America does not want to witness a food fight. They want to know how we’re going to put food on their table. So, on that point, part of the issue that is at play in America today, and we’ve all been traveling around the country, I certainly have, I’m meeting people who are working two and three jobs. You know, this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy, right? My great economy. My great economy. You ask him, well, how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours and he talks about the stock market. Well, that’s fine if you own stocks. So many families in America do not. You ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers. Well, yeah, people in America are working. They’re working two and three jobs. So, when we talk about jobs, let’s be very clear. In our America, no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table.
502	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	6.0	Sen. Harris’ ‘food fight’ moment	Thank you very much, senator. Yes.
503	HOLT	Moderator	6.0	Sen. Harris’ ‘food fight’ moment	You have all–you’ve all expressed an interest in talking about healthcare. So, let’s–
648	YANG	Candidate	9.0	Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	Well, I just want to agree that I think Russia is our biggest geopolitical threat because they’ve been hacking our democracy successfully. They’ve been laughing their asses off about it for the last couple of years and we should focus on that before we start worrying about other threats. Now, China, they do–they do (INAUDIBLE) property. It’s a massive problem. But the tariffs and the trade war are just punishing businesses and producers and workers on both sides. I met with a farmer in Iowa who said he spent six years building up a buying relationship in China that’s now disappeared and gone forever. And the beneficiaries have not been American workers or–or people in China. It’s been Southeast Asia and other producers that have then stepped into the void. So, we need to–to crack down on Chinese malfeasance in the trade relationship but the tariffs and the trade war are the wrong way to go.
649	HOLT	Moderator	9.0	Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	how would you stand up against China?
650	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	9.0	Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	Yeah, I mean first of all, we’ve got to recognize that the China challenge really is a serious one. This is not something to dismiss or wave away. And if you look at what China is doing. They’re using technology for the perfection of dictatorship. But, their fundamental economic model isn’t gonna change because of some tariffs. I live in the industrial Midwest. Folks who aren’t in the shadow of a factory or somewhere near a soy field where I live. And manufacturers, and especially soy farmers, are hurting. Tariffs are taxes. And Americans are gonna pay on average $800 more a year because of these tariffs. Meanwhile, China is investing so that they could soon be able to run circles around us in artificial intelligence. And this president is fixated on the China relationship as if all that mattered was the export balance on dishwashers. We’ve got a much bigger issue on our hands. But in a moment when their authoritarian model is being held up as an alternative to ours because ours looks so chaotic compared to theirs right now because of our internal divisions. The biggest thing we’ve got to do is invest in our own domestic competitiveness. If we disinvest–
651	HOLT	Moderator	9.0	Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	–All right, mayor, thank you.
652	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	9.0	Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	–In our own infrastructure, education we are never gonna be able to compete. And if we really want to be an alternative, a democratic alternative, we actually have to demonstrate that we care about democratic values–
653	HOLT	Moderator	9.0	Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	–Mayor, thank you, thank you for your answer.
654	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	9.0	Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	–At home.
665	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	Because I couldn’t get it done. My community is in anguish right now because of an officer involved shooting. A black man Eric Logan killed by a white officer. And I’m not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back. The officer says he was attacked with a knife, but he didn’t have his body camera on. It’s a mess. And we’re hurting. And I could walk you through all of the things that we have done as a community–all of the steps that we took from bias training to de-escalation but it didn’t save the life of Eric Logan. And when I look into his mother’s eyes I have to face the fact and nothing that I say will bring him back. This is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country. And until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism whatever this particular incident teaches us we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that there is a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time. Not just from what has happened in the past but what’s happening around the country in the present. It threatens the well being of every community. And I am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle when they see a police officer approaching feels the exact same thing. A feeling not of fear but of safety. I’m determined to bring that day about.
666	MADDOW	Moderator	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
667	HICKENLOOPER	Candidate	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	Mayor Buttigieg, Mayor Buttigieg, if I could ask one question because I think–
668	MADDOW	Moderator	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	Governor, I’ll give you 30 seconds.
669	HICKENLOOPER	Candidate	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	I think that the question they are asking in South Bend I think across the country is why is it taking so long? We had a shooting when I first became mayor 10 years before Ferguson and the community came together and we created an office of the independent monitor–civilian oversight commission. We diversified the police force in two years. We actually did de-escalation training. I think the real question that America should be asking is why five years after Ferguson every city doesn’t have this level of police accountability?
670	MADDOW	Moderator	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	Governor Hickenlooper, thank you.
671	HICKENLOOPER	Candidate	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	We–
672	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	I’ve got to respond to that. Look, we’ve taken so many steps toward police accountability that the FOP just denounced me for too much accountability. We’re obviously not there yet. And I accept responsibility for that–
673	SWALWELL	Candidate	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	(INAUDIBLE) you should fire the chief.
674	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	So, under Indiana law this will be investigated. And there will be accountability for the officer involved.
675	SWALWELL	Candidate	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	But you’re the mayor. You should fire the chief if that’s the policy and someone died.
676	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	All of these issues are extremely important but there are specifics, there are symptoms. And the underlying cause has to do with deep, deep, deep realms of racial injustice. Both in our criminal justice system and in our economic system. And the democratic party should be on the side of reparations for slavery for this very reason. I do not believe–I do not believe that the average American is a racist. But the average American is woefully undereducated about the history of race in the United States.
677	TODD	Moderator	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	Vice President Biden, we’re going to get to you. Hang on. We’re going to get–
678	HARRIS	Candidate	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	I would like to say–
679	MADDOW	Moderator	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	–Ms. Williamson, thank you very much.
713	SANDERS	Candidate	13.0	Candidates comment on diversity	No, absolutely not. Unlike the Republican party we encourage diverse city, we believe in diverse city, that is what America is up about. But in addition to diversity in terms of having more women, more people from the GB–L–LGBT community we also have to do something else and that is we have to ask ourselves a simple question and that how come to day the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1 percent has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth. We need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interest who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.
714	TODD	Moderator	13.0	Candidates comment on diversity	Senator Gillibrand I want to give you 30 seconds on this.
715	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	13.0	Candidates comment on diversity	Well, first of all where Bernie left off we have heard a lot of good ideas on this stage tonight and a lot of plans but the truth is until you go to the root of the corruption, the money in the–in politics, the fact that Washington is run by these special interest you are never going to solve any of these problems. I have the most comprehensive approach that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption to get money out of politics through publicly funded elections, to have clean elections. If we do that and get money out of politics we can guarantee healthcare as a right not a privilege we can deal with institutional racism, we can’t take on income inequality and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs Washington.
718	BENNET	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Gridlock will not magically disappear as long as Mitch McConnell is there, first. Second, second, that is why it is so important for us to when not just the presidency to have somebody that can run in all 50 states but to–but to win the Senate as well and that is why we have to propose policies that can be supported like Medicare X (PH) so that we can build a broad coalition of Americans to overcome broken Washington DC. I agree with what Senator Gillibrand was saying and share a lot of her views. We need to in gerrymandering in wash–and we need to end political gerrymandering in Washington. The court today said they couldn’t do anything about it. We need to overturn Citizens United. The court was the one that gave us Citizens United. And the attack on voting rights in Shelby versus Holder is something we need to deal with. All of those things has happened since Vice President Biden was in the Senate. And we face structural problems that we have to overcome with a broad coalition. It’s the only way we can do it. We need to root out the corruption in Washington, expand people’s right to get to the polls.
719	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Time is up. Thank you.
720	BENNET	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	And I think then we can succeed.
721	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Vice President Biden–
722	BIDEN	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Can I respond–
723	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Thirty seconds. I want–I–what–it does sound as if you haven’t seen what’s been happening in the United States Senate over the last 12 years. It didn’t happen. Why?
724	BIDEN	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	I have seen what happened just sense we were vice president. We needed three votes to pass an $800 billion recovery act that kept us from going into depression. I got three votes changed. We needed to be able to keep the government from shutting down and going bankrupt. I got Mitch McConnell to raise taxes $600 billion by raising the top rate. And as recently as after the President got elected, I was able to put together a coalition on the Cures Act that billions of dollars go into cancer research, bipartisan. But sometimes you can’t do that. Sometimes you just have to go out and beat them. I went into 20 states, over 60 candidates–
725	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Okay, thank you–
726	BIDEN	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–And guess what? We beat them. We won back the Senate.
727	BENNET	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Chuck? Chuck?
728	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Thank you.
729	BENNET	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Chuck–
730	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Thank you, Mr.–
731	BENNET	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–The problem with what the vice–
732	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Go ahead, 30 seconds–
733	BENNET	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–No. What?
734	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Yeah, 30 seconds. Go ahead.
735	BENNET	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	We–sometimes you do have to beat them, but–but the deal that he talked about with Mitch McConnell was a complete victory for the Tea Party. It extended the Bush tax cuts permanently. The Democratic Party had been running against that for 10 years. We’ve lost that economic argument because that deal extended almost all those Bush tax cuts permanently and put in place the mindless cuts that we still are dealing with today that are called the sequester. That was a great deal for Mitch McConnell.
736	BIDEN	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Oh, come on.
737	BENNET	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	It was a terrible deal for America.
738	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Thank you. Thank you, Senator Bennet.
739	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	And you heard from Republicans.
740	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Right, right.
741	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	You heard from the Republicans–
742	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Go ahead, 30 seconds–
743	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–That the reason why the Trump tax cut had to be passed is because they had to pay back their donors. You heard it. They actually said those words. So, the corruption in Washington is real, and it is something that makes every one of the plans we’ve heard about over the last several months impossible. And I have the most comprehensive approach to do it with clean elections, publicly funded elections so we restore the power of our democracy into the hands of the voters, not into the Koch brothers. We were talking about issues. Imagine–we’re in Florida. Imagine the Parkland kids having as much power in our democracy–
744	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Thank you–
745	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–As the Koch brothers or the NRA.
746	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Thank you, Senator Gillibrand. Thank you.
747	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Imagine their voices carrying–Farther and wider than–
748	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Thank you–
749	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Anyone else because their voice is needed.
750	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Go ahead. Senator Gillibrand, I’m trying–
751	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–And you can–and as president–
752	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–To get everyone in here–
753	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–It’s the first thing I’m going–
754	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Thank you–
755	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–To do because nothing else is possible, whether it’s education or healthcare or ending institutional racism.
758	SANDERS	Candidate	15.0	Candidates on abortion rights	Well, my plan is somebody who believes, for a start, that a woman’s right to control her own body is a constitutional right, that government and politicians should not infringe on that right. We will do everything we can to defense our–Roe versus Wade. Second of all, let me make– –Let me make–let me make a promise here. You asked about litmus test. My litmus test is I will never appoint any–nominate any justice to the Supreme Court unless that justice is 100 percent clear he or she will defend Roe v. Wade. Third of all, I do not believe in packing the court.
759	SANDERS	Candidate	15.0	Candidates on abortion rights	right now. But I do believe that constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts. And that brings in new blood into the supreme court and a majority I hope that will understand that a woman has the right to control her own body and that corporations cannot run the United States of America.
760	MADDOW	Moderator	15.0	Candidates on abortion rights	Senator
761	MADDOW	Moderator	15.0	Candidates on abortion rights	I’m going to give you 10 additional seconds because (INAUDIBLE) what if the court has already overturned Roe and Roe is gone? All of the things you have described would be to try to preserve Roe. If Roe was gone what could you do as president to preserve abortion rights?
762	SANDERS	Candidate	15.0	Candidates on abortion rights	Well, first of all let me tell you this–didn’t come up yet but let’s face this–Medicare for All guarantees every woman in this country the right to have an abortion if she wants it.
763	MADDOW	Moderator	15.0	Candidates on abortion rights	Thank you, Senator.
764	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	15.0	Candidates on abortion rights	And can I just address this for a second? And I–and I want to talk directly-directly to America’s women and to men who love them–women’s reproductive rights are under assault by President Trump and the Republican party. Thirty states are trying to overturn Roe v. Wade right now. And it is mind boggling to me that we are debating this on this stage in 2019 among democrats whether women should have access to reproductive rights. I think we have to stop playing defense and start playing offense. But let me tell you one thing about politics because it goes to the corruption of the deal making–when the door is closed negotiations are made. There are conversations about women’s rights and compromises have been made behind our backs. That’s how we got to Hyde. That’s how the Hyde Amendment was created. A compromise by leaders of both parties. Then we have the ACA. During the ACA neg–negotiations I had to fight like heck with other women to make sure that contraception wasn’t sold down the river or abortion services. And so, what we need to know is imagine this one question–when we beat President Trump and Mitch McConnell walks into the Oval Office god forbid to do negotiations who do you want when that door closes to be sitting behind that desk to fight for women’s rights? I have been the fiercest advocate for women’s reproductive freedom for over a decade.
765	MADDOW	Moderator	15.0	Candidates on abortion rights	Thank you.
766	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	15.0	Candidates on abortion rights	And I promise you as President–
767	TODD	Moderator	15.0	Candidates on abortion rights	Senator–
768	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	15.0	Candidates on abortion rights	–when that door closes I will guarantee women’s reproductive (INAUDIBLE) no matter what.
771	HARRIS	Candidate	16.0	Candidates on climate	Well, first of all I don’t even call it climate change. It’s a climate crisis. It represents an existential threat to us as a species. And the fact that we have a President of the United States who has embraced science fiction over science fact will be to our collective peril. I visited while the embers were smoldering the wildfires in California I spoke with firefighters who were in the midst of fighting a fire while their own homes were burning. And on this issue it is a–it is a critical issue that is about what we must do to confront what is immediate and before us right now. That is why I support a Green New Deal. It is why I believe on day one and as President will re-enter us in the Paris agreement because we have to take these issues seriously and frankly, we have a President of the United States we talked about you asked before what is the greatest national security threat to the United States? It’s Donald Trump. And I’m going to tell you why. And I’m going to tell you why because I agree climate change represents an existential threat. He denies the science. You want to talk about North Korea, real threat in terms of nuclear arsenal but what doe she do? He embraces Kim Jong Un a dictator
772	HARRIS	Candidate	16.0	Candidates on climate	History where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people.
773	BIDEN	Candidate	16.0	Candidates on climate	I have supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran for (INAUDIBLE).
774	TODD	Moderator	16.0	Candidates on climate	Vice President Biden 30 seconds because I want to bring other people into this.
775	BIDEN	Candidate	16.0	Candidates on climate	I–I supported the ERA from the very beginning. I am the guy that extended the voting rights act for 25 years. We got to the place where we got 98 out of 98 votes in the United States Senate doing it. I have also argued very strongly that we in fact deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box. I agree that everybody once they in fact–my time is up. I’m sorry.
776	TODD	Moderator	16.0	Candidates on climate	Thank you vice president.
777	HARRIS	Candidate	16.0	Candidates on climate	All of these things (INAUDIBLE).
778	TODD	Moderator	16.0	Candidates on climate	Senator Sanders–Senator Sanders, I want to go to you on this. You said on the day you launched your campaign that voters should focus on what people stand for, not a candidate’s race or age or sexual orientation. Any Democrats are very excited by the diversity of this field on this stage and on last night stage and the perspective that diverse city brings to this contest and to these issues. Are you telling Democratic voters that diverse city should it matter when they make this decision?
779	SANDERS	Candidate	16.0	Candidates on climate	No, absolutely not. Unlike the Republican party we encourage diverse city, we believe in diverse city, that is what America is up about. But in addition to diversity in terms of having more women, more people from the GB–L–LGBT community we also have to do something else and that is we have to ask ourselves a simple question and that how come to day the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1 percent has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth. We need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interest who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.
780	TODD	Moderator	16.0	Candidates on climate	Senator Gillibrand I want to give you 30 seconds on this.
781	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	16.0	Candidates on climate	Well, first of all where Bernie left off we have heard a lot of good ideas on this stage tonight and a lot of plans but the truth is until you go to the root of the corruption, the money in the–in politics, the fact that Washington is run by these special interest you are never going to solve any of these problems. I have the most comprehensive approach that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption to get money out of politics through publicly funded elections, to have clean elections. If we do that and get money out of politics we can guarantee healthcare as a right not a privilege we can deal with institutional racism, we can’t take on income inequality and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs Washington.
784	BENNET	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	Gridlock will not magically disappear as long as Mitch McConnell is there, first. Second, second, that is why it is so important for us to when not just the presidency to have somebody that can run in all 50 states but to–but to win the Senate as well and that is why we have to propose policies that can be supported like Medicare X so that we can build a broad coalition of Americans to overcome broken Washington DC. I agree with what Senator Gillibrand was saying and share a lot of her views. We need to in gerrymandering in wash–and we need to end political gerrymandering in Washington.
785	BIDEN	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	And new science and technology to be the exporter not only of the green economy, but economy that can create millions of jobs. But, I would immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. I would up the ante in that accord, which it calls for because we make up 15 percent of the problem; 85 percent of the world makes up the rest. And so, we have to have someone who knows how to corral the rest of the world, bring them together, and get something done like we did in our administrator.
786	MADDOW	Moderator	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	Senators–senators, I want–to give you 30 seconds–
787	SANDERS	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–Look–
788	MADDOW	Moderator	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–To follow up, but I’m going to hold you to 30 seconds.
789	SANDERS	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	Look, the old ways are no longer relevant. The scientists tell us we have 12 years because there’s irreparable damage to this planet. This is a global issue. What the president of the United States should do is not deny the reality of climate change, but tell the rest of the world that instead of spending $1.5 trillion on weapons of destruction, let us get together for the common enemy and that is to transform the world energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency, and sustainable energy.
790	MADDOW	Moderator	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	Thank you.
791	SANDERS	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	The future of the planet rests on us doing that.
792	SWALWELL	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	There–there’s–
793	TODD	Moderator	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–Before we go–
794	SWALWELL	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–There’s–
795	TODD	Moderator	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–Hang on.
796	MADDOW	Moderator	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	Before we leave this topic–
797	SWALWELL	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–Here’s a solution. Pass the torch. Pass the torch to the generation that’s going to feel the effects–
798	(UNKNOWN)	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–No–
799	SANDERS	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–Of climate change–take on the fossil fuel–
800	SWALWELL	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–Pass the torch to the generation–
801	SANDERS	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–Is (CROSSTALK) the solution–
802	(UNKNOWN)	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–That’s inventive enough–
803	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–Agreed. And–
804	MADDOW	Moderator	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–Before we leave this topic–here’s something you all want to weigh in on. Hold on a moment.
805	TODD	Moderator	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	Just–just–
806	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–Campaign to the Republican Party.
807	MADDOW	Moderator	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	Hold on moment.
808	TODD	Moderator	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	Just trust us on this.
809	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	And the fact–
871	SWALWELL	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Keep your pistols, keep your rifles, keep your shotguns but we can take the most dangerous weapons from the most dangerous people. We have the NRA on the ropes because of the Moms because the Brady Group, because of Giffords, because of March for Our Lives. But I’m the only candidate on this stage calling for a ban and buyback of every single assault weapon in America. I’ve seen the plans of the other candidates here. They would all leave 15 million assault in our communities. They wouldn’t do a single thing to save a single life in Parkland. I will approach this issue as a prosecutor. I will approach it as the only person on this stage who has voted and passed background checks–but also as a parent of a generation who sends our children to school where we look at what they’re wearing so we can remember it in case we have to identify them later. A generation who has seen thousands of black children killed in our streets and a generation who goes to the theater and we actually where the fire exits are. We don’t have to live this way. We must be a country who loves our children more than we love our guns.
872	MADDOW	Moderator	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Senator Sanders a Vermont newspaper recently released portions of an interview you gave in 2013 in which you said, “My own view on guns is everything being equal, states should make those decisions.
873	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	No.
874	MADDOW	Moderator	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Has your thinking changed since then? Do you now think there’s a federal role to play?
875	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Mischaracterization of my thinking. Look–
876	MADDOW	Moderator	20.0	Candidates on gun control	It’s a quote of you.
877	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	We have a gun–we have a gun crisis right now. 40,000 people a year are getting killed. In 1988, Rachel, when it wasn’t popular I ran on a platform of banning assault weapons and in fact, lost that race for Congress. I have a D minus voting record from the NRA. And I believe that what we need is comprehensive gun–gun legislation that, among other things, provides universal background. We end the gun show loophole. We end the straw man provision. And I believed in 1988 and I believe today that assault weapons–
878	SWALWELL	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–Why would you–why would you leave 15 million on the streets–
879	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–Assault weapons–assault weapons–
880	SWALWELL	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–Why would you leave–Senator–
881	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–Are weapons–
882	SWALWELL	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–You leave 15 million on the streets–
883	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–Are from the military–
884	SWALWELL	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–Though–
885	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–And that they should not be on the streets–
886	SWALWELL	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–Why do you leave–
887	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–Of America.
888	SWALWELL	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	You would–your plan leaves them on the streets. You leave 15 million on the streets.
889	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	We ban the sale and–we ban the sale and distribution–
890	SWALWELL	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–Will you buy them back–
891	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–And that’s what I’ve believed for many years.
892	SWALWELL	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Will you–will you buy them back?
893	HARRIS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	And then–and–and–
894	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–If people want to buy–if the government wants to do that, if people want bring it back–
895	SWALWELL	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–But you’re going to be the government–
896	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–Yes–
897	SWALWELL	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–Will you buy them back?
898	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Yeah.
899	MADDOW	Moderator	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Senator Harris, we’re going to give you 30 seconds here.
900	HARRIS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Thank you. I think your idea is a great one, Congressman Swalwell. And I will say there are a lot of great idea. The problem is Congress has not had the courage to act, which is why, when elected president of the United States, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to pull their act together, bring all these good ideas together, and put a bill on my desk for signature. And if they do not, I will take executive action and I will put in place–The most comprehensive background check policy we’ve had. I will require the ATF to take the licenses of gun dealers who violate the law. And I will banned by executive order the importation of assault weapons, because I’m going to tell you, as a prosecutor, I have seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers who are the mothers of homicide victims, and I have attended more police officer funerals. It is enough. It is enough. And there have been plenty of good ideas from members of the United States Congress. There’s been no action. As president, I will take action.
901	MADDOW	Moderator	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Mayor Buttigieg–I want to bring you in on this, sir; a lot of discussion about assault rifles that are often as shorthanded as military style weapons. You are the only person on the stage tonight with military experience as a veteran of the Afghanistan war. Will military families–does that inform your thinking on this view? Do you believe that military families or America’s veterans will, at large, have a different take on this than the other Americans who we’ve been talking about and who Congressman Swalwell is appealing to with his buyback program?
902	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Yeah, of course, because we trained on some of these kinds of weapons. Look, every part of my life experience informs this, being the mayor of a city where the worst part of the job is dealing with violence. We–we lose a–as many as were lost at Parkland every two or three years in my city alone. And this is tearing communities apart. If more guns made us safer, we be the safest country on earth. It doesn’t work that way. And commonsense measures like universal background checks can’t seem to get delivered by Washington, even when most Republicans, let alone most Americans, agree it’s the right thing to do. And as somebody who trained on weapons of war, I can tell you that there are weapons that have absolutely no place in American cities or neighborhoods in peacetime, ever.
903	MADDOW	Moderator	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Vice President Biden, 30 seconds.
904	BIDEN	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	A real 30 seconds?
905	MADDOW	Moderator	20.0	Candidates on gun control	A real 30 seconds.
906	BIDEN	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Okay. I’m the only person that’s beaten the NRA nationally. I’m the guy that got the Brady Bill passed, the background checks, number one. Number two, we increased that background check when–when–during the Obama-Biden administration. I’m also the only guy that got assault weapons banned, banned, and the number of clips in a gun banned. And so, folks, look, and I would buy back those weapons. We already started talking about that. We tried to get it done. I think it can be done. And it should be demanded that we do it, and that’s a good expenditure of money. And lastly, we should have smart guns. No gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger. It’s within our right to do that. We can do that. Our enemy is the gun manufacturers, not the NRA, the gun manufacturers.
907	MADDOW	Moderator	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Mr. Vice President, thank you.
908	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	But the NRA is taking orders from–
909	TODD	Moderator	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–All right–
910	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–The gun manufacturers. That’s the problem.
911	TODD	Moderator	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Lester Holt has our next question. Lester, take it away.
912	HOLT	Moderator	20.0	Candidates on gun control	All right, Chuck. This is a question from our viewers. We put some suggestions that asked maybe they could share some of. Here’s one that came from Kathleen (PH) from Canby, Oregon, who writes many fear the current administration has inflicted irrevocable harm on our governing institutions and norms and, in the process, on our reputation abroad. The question is what do you see as importance early steps in reversing the damage done? And will put this one to Senator Bennet.
913	BENNET	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Thank you very much. What an excellent question. First of all, we have to restore our democracy at home. The rest of the world is looking for us for leadership. We have a president who doesn’t believe in the role of law. He doesn’t believe in freedom of the press. He doesn’t believe in an independent judiciary. He believes in the corruption that he’s brought to Washington D.C. And that is what we have to change. And that’s why everybody is up here tonight. And I appreciate the fact that there up here for that reason. Second, we’ve got to–we’ve got to restore the relationships that he’s destroyed with our allies, not just in Europe. He flew to the G20 last night and attacked Japan, Germany, and a third ally of ours without saying anything about North Korea or Russia. And when you’ve got a situation where you have a president who says something happens in the Straits of Hormuz and the whole world doesn’t know whether to believe it or not, that is a huge problem when it comes to the national security of the United States of America.
914	TODD	Moderator	20.0	Candidates on gun control	This is a perfect time–
915	BENNET	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–And we need to change that.
918	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	Well, one of my first phone calls would be to call the European leaders and say we are back because I totally understand how important it is that the United States be part of the Western alliance.
919	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	Okay. I want–I’m trying to get one–one or two words here. I–guy here you. Governor Hickenlooper?
920	HICKENLOOPER	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	You know I talk about constant engagement and I think the first–the first country I would go to but I understand they have been cheating and stealing intellectual property would be China because–
921	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	Okay.
922	HICKENLOOPER	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	–because if we are going to do deal with–deal with public health pandemics and we are going to deal with–
923	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	Thank you.
924	HICKENLOOPER	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	–all of the challenges of the globe we’ve got to have relationships with everyone.
925	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	Mr. Yang, we will try to squeeze in a couple of more things before we go to another break. Mr. Yang?
926	YANG	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	China, we need to cooperate with them on climate change, AI, and other issues, North Korea.
927	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	Thanks for the quickness. Mayor Buttigieg?
928	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	We have no idea which of our most important allies he will have pissed off between now and then. What we know is that our relationship–with the entire world needs to change. And it starts by modeling American values at home.
929	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	Okay. Mr. Vice President, we are trying to be quick.
930	BIDEN	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	We know NATO will fall apart if he is elected for more years it is the single most consequential alliance–
931	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	Okay.
932	BIDEN	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	–in the history of the United States.
933	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	Senator Sanders?
934	SANDERS	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	It’s not one country. I think it is rebuilding trust in the United Nations and understand that we can solve conflicts without war but with diplomacy.
935	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	Senator Harris?
936	HARRIS	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	All of the members of the NATO alliance.
937	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	Senator Gillibrand?
938	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	President Trump is hell-bent on starting a war with Iran. My first act will be to engage Iran to stabilize the Middle East and make sure we do not start an unwanted never-ending war.
939	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	Senator Bennet quickly.
940	BENNET	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	Our European allies and every Latin American country that is willing to have a conversation about how to deal with the refugee crisis.
941	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	And Congressman Swalwell?
944	BIDEN	Candidate	22.0	Biden on why Americans should trust his foreign policy judgment after he expressed regret for supporting the Iraq war	Because once we–once Bush abuse that power what happened was we got elected after that. I made sure the president turned to me and said Joe, get our combat troops out of Iraq. I was responsible for getting 150,000 combat troops out of Iraq and my son was one of them. I also think we should not have combat troops in Afghanistan. It’s long overdue. It should end. And I thirdly I believe that you are not going to find anybody who has pulled together more of our alliances to deal with what is the real stateless threat out there. We cannot go it alone in terms of dealing with terrorism. So I would eliminate the–the act that allowed us to go into war and not the AU and fan make sure that it could only be used for what it’s intended–what its intent was and that is to go after terrorist but never do it alone. That is why we have to repair our alliances. We put together 65 countries to make sure we dealt with ISIS in Iraq and other places. That is what I would do. That is what I have done and I know how to do it.
945	MADDOW	Moderator	22.0	Biden on why Americans should trust his foreign policy judgment after he expressed regret for supporting the Iraq war	Senator Sanders, 30 seconds.
946	SANDERS	Candidate	22.0	Biden on why Americans should trust his foreign policy judgment after he expressed regret for supporting the Iraq war	One of the differences–one of the differences that Joe and I have in our record is Joe voted for that work, I helped lead the opposition to that or which was a total disaster. Second of all, I helped lead the effort for the first time to utilize the War Powers Act to get the United States out of these Saudi led intervention in Yemen which is the most horrific humanitarian disaster on Earth. And thirdly let me be very clear, I will do everything I can to prevent a war with Iran which would be far worse than disastrous war with Iraq.
947	MADDOW	Moderator	22.0	Biden on why Americans should trust his foreign policy judgment after he expressed regret for supporting the Iraq war	Senator Sanders thank you.
948	TODD	Moderator	22.0	Biden on why Americans should trust his foreign policy judgment after he expressed regret for supporting the Iraq war	All right, guys.
949	BIDEN	Candidate	22.0	Biden on why Americans should trust his foreign policy judgment after he expressed regret for supporting the Iraq war	Informed consent of the American people.
950	TODD	Moderator	22.0	Biden on why Americans should trust his foreign policy judgment after he expressed regret for supporting the Iraq war	Good news is you get more time to talk but I have to sneak in one more break.
951	MADDOW	Moderator	22.0	Biden on why Americans should trust his foreign policy judgment after he expressed regret for supporting the Iraq war	–right back.
