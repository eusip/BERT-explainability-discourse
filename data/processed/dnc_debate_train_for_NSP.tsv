All right.
So with that business out of the way, we want to get to it.
And we’ll start this evening with Senator Elizabeth Warren., Senator, good evening to you.
Thank you.
Good to be here.

OK, thank you, Senator Warren.
You didn’t address — do you think the federal government needs to go and figure out a way to get the guns that are already out there?
What I think we need to do is we need to treat it like a serious research problem, which we have not done.
You know, guns in the hands of a collector who’s had them for decades, who’s never fired them, who takes safety seriously, that’s very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly.
We can’t treat this as an across-the-board problem.
We have to treat it like a public health emergency.
That means bring data to bear and it means make real change in this country, whether it’s politically popular or not.
Thank you, Senator.
Senator Booker, you have a program…
We need to fight for our children.
Senator Booker, you have a federal government buyback program in your plan.
How is that going to work?
Well, first of all, I want to say, my colleague and I both have been hearing this on the campaign trail.
But what’s even worse is I hear gunshots in my neighborhood.
I think I’m the only one — I hope I’m the only one on this panel here that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week.
Someone I knew, Shahad Smith, was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year.
For millions of Americans, this is not a policy issue.
This is an urgency.
And for those that have not been directly affected, they’re tired of living in country where their kids go to school to learn about reading, writing, and arithmetic, and how to deal with an active shooter in their school.
This is something that I’m tired of.
And I’m tired of hearing people all, they have to offer is thoughts and prayers.
In my faith, people say faith without works is dead.
So we will find a way.
But the reason we have a problem right now is we’ve let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate.
It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda.
I will get that done as president of the United States because this is not about policy.
This is personal.
Thank you, Senator Booker.
Secretary Castro, I’d like to talk to you about something that Senator Booker just mentioned there, the idea of active shooter drills in schools, as school shootings seem like an almost everyday or every week occurrence now.
They don’t make a complete news cycle anymore, no matter the death toll.
As parents are so afraid as their kids go off to school that their kids will be caught up in something like this, next to nothing has changed in federal law that might affect the prevalence of school shootings.
Is this a problem that is going to continue to get worse over our lifetimes?
Or is there something that you would do as president that you really think would turn it around?
You know, Rachel, I am the dad of a 10-year-old girl, Carina, who’s here tonight.
And the worst thing is knowing that your child might be worried about what could happen at school, a place that’s supposed to be safe.
The answer to your question is no.
We don’t have to accept that.
And I believe that, on January 20, 2021, at 12:01 p.m., we’re going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House, and a Democratic Senate.
And the activists of Parkland, folks from Moms Demand who have risen up across the United States and inspired so many people… … you know, we may not have seen yet legislative action, but we’re getting closer.
The House took a vote.
In the Senate, the question often is, if the decision is between 60 votes, a filibuster, or passing commonsense gun reform, I’m going to choose commonsense gun reform.
So I believe that we’re going to be able to get that done in 2021.
Secretary Castro, thank you.
Rachel, I have something to add to this briefly, because…
We’ll give you — it’ll be 30 seconds for a follow-up on that question — on that answer from Secretary Castro.
Congressman Ryan?
You’re talking about in the schools.
These kids are traumatized.
I support all the gun reforms here.
We need to start dealing with the trauma that our kids have.
We need trauma-based care in every school.
We need social and emotional learning in every school.
Ninety percent of the shooters who do school shootings come from the school they’re in, and 73 percent of them feel shamed, traumatized, or bullied.
We need to make sure that these kids feel connected to the school.
That means a mental health counselor in every single school in the United States.
We need to start playing offense.
If our kids are so traumatized that they’re getting a gun and going into our schools, we’re doing something wrong, too, and we need reform around trauma-based care.
Thank you, Congressman Ryan.
Congressman O’Rourke, you’re a Texan who’s campaigned — you campaigned all over the state in 2018 in the most conservative parts there.
What do you tell a gun owner who may agree with you on everything else, OK, but says, you know what, the Democrats, if I vote for them in there, they’re going to take my gun away, and even though I agree with you on all these other issues — how do you have that conversation?
Here’s how we have that conversation in Texas.
I shared with them what I learned from those students who survived the Santa Fe high school shooting, a young student named Bree.
Her friend, Marcel, who survived another shooting, the mother of a victim who lost her life, Rhonda Hart, they talked about universal background checks, where you close every loophole.
We know that they save lives.
We talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities.
Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible.
They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities.
Red flag laws, so if someone poses a danger to themselves or to someone else, they’re stopped before it’s too late.
And what I found in each one of those 254 counties is that Democrats and independents and Republicans, gun-owners and non-gun-owners alike, agreed.
But this effort must be led by the young people that you referenced at the beginning of this issue.
Those students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas led the charge here in Florida, and they’ve been able to change those laws.
They’re making our democracy work, ensuring that our values and our interests and our priorities are reflected in the laws that we pass.
Thank you, Congressman O’Rourke.
Hang on.
Let me give 30 seconds, Senator Klobuchar, the iron range.
I’m curious.
Gun confiscation, right?
If the government is buying back, how do you not have that conversation?
Well, that’s not confiscation.
You could give them the offer to buy back their gun.
But I’ll say this.
I look at these proposals and I say, does this hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand, coming from a proud hunting and fishing state?
These proposals don’t do that.
When I was a prosecutor, I supported the assault weapons ban.
When I was in the Senate, I saw those moms from Sandy Hook come and try to advocate for change, and we all failed.
And then now these Parkland kids from Florida, they started literally a national shift.
You know why?
It’s just like with gay marriage.
When kids talked to their parents and their grandparents, they say I don’t understand why we can’t put these sensible things in place, they listen.
And if we get bested by a bunch of 17-year-olds…
All right, Senator, thank you.
… it’s the best thing that ever happened.
We need to get…
Senator, thank you.
Senator, thank you.
Senator Booker, let me go to you on another matter actually.
We’ve got to…

I’m going to get to — I’m going to get a couple of you in here.
I’m going to get a couple of you in here.
Thirty seconds, Congressman Delaney, you seem to believe you can do everything in a bipartisan manner.
Mitch McConnell doesn’t operate that way.
He operates differently.
Why do you think he is going to conform to your style?
I think we need to get things done.
That’s why I believe we need to operate in a bipartisan manner.
Listen, I will sign into law bills that come to the White House that are passed on a party-line basis, absolutely.
But all the big transformative things we’ve ever done in this country’s history have happened when huge majoritiesof the American people get behind them, which is why we need real solutions, not impossible promises.
We need to put forth ideas that work, whether it’s on health care, creating universal health care so that every American gets health care, but not running on making private insurance illegal.
The gun issue is related.
The gun safety issue is related, because I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been with folks in Western Maryland, and they’ve said to me, you know, Democrats don’t do anything for us, Republicans don’t do anything for us.
You fight all the time, so they vote on that single issue.
OK.
If we become the party of getting things done for the American people, with real solutions and not impossible promises, we’ll be able to get all these things done.
I promised…
Senator Booker, 30 seconds.
You — how do you deal with Mitch?
You’ve been in the Senate.
You can’t get bills on the floor right now with Mitch McConnell.
Presidents can’t do it.
Is President Booker going to get his bills on the floor with Senator McConnell?
You know, when I got to the United States Senate, going back to what De Blasio said, as an African-American man in an African-American-dominated community, I knew one of the biggest issue was criminal justice reform, from police accountability to dealing with the fact that we have a nation that has more African-Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850.
And when I got to the Senate, people told me we could not get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done.
As my colleagues in the Senate know, I fought on that bill from the day I got to the Senate, built coalitions across the aisle, and today we passed the First Step Act.
It’s not as far as I want to go, but thousands of people will be liberated.
I have gotten — I have taken on tough problems people said we cannot achieve, and I’ve been able to get things accomplished.
Thank you, Senator Booker.
Rachel has got the next question.

Governor Inslee, thank you.
Congressman O’Rourke, you also put out a big climate change plan from your campaign.
You want some big changes in a pretty short period of time, including switching to renewable energy, pushing to replace gas-powered cars in favor of electric ones.
What’s your message to a voter who supports the overall goal of what you’re trying to do, but suddenly feels as if government’s telling them how to live and ordering them how to live?
What is that balance like?
I think you’ve got to bring everybody in to the decisions and the solutions to the challenges that we face.
That’s why we’re traveling everywhere, listening to everyone.
We were in Pacific Junction, a town that had never meaningly flooded before, just up against the Missouri River in Iowa.
And every home in that community had flooded.
There were farms just outside of Pacific Junction that were effectively lakes, those farmers already underwater in debt, their markets closed to them by a trade war under this administration, and now they don’t know what to do.
We in our administration are going fund resiliency in those communities, in Miami, in Houston, Texas, those places that are on the front lines of climate change today.
We’re going to mobilize $5 trillion in this economy over the next 10 years.
We’re going to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels, and we’re going to put farmers and ranchers in the driver’s seat, renewable and sustainable agriculture, to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil, paying farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide.
If all of us does all that we can, then we’re going to be able to keep this planet from warming another 2 degrees Celsius, and ensure that we match what this country can do and live up to our promise and our potential.
Thirty seconds, Secretary Castro, does — who pays for the mitigation to — to climate, whether it’s building sea walls, for people that are perhaps living in places that they shouldn’t be living?
Is this a federal government issue that needs to do that?
Do they have to move these people?
What do you do about that, where maybe they’re building a place someplace that isn’t safe?
Who pays to build that house?
And how much should the government be bailing them out?
Well, I don’t think that that represents the vast majority of the issue.
In fact, you know, my first visit after I announced my candidacy wasn’t to Iowa or New Hampshire.
It was to San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Because people should know that if I’m elected president, everybody will count.
And, you know, I’m one of the few candidates in this race with executive experience, with a track record of getting things done.
When I was mayor of San Antonio, we moved our local public utility, we began to shift it from coal-fired plants to solar and other renewables, and also created more than 800 jobs doing that.
And when I was HUD secretary, we worked on the National Disaster Resilience Competition to invest in communities that were trying to rebuild from natural disasters in a sustainable way.
That’s the way that we’re going to help make sure that we’re all safer in the years to come and that we combat climate change.
Thank you.
And if I’m elected president, the first thing that I would do, like Senator Klobuchar also has said, is sign an executive order recommitting us to the Paris Climate Accord so that we lead again…
All right.
Congressman Ryan, I got a full question for you here, which is simply this.
There are — a lot of the climate plans include pricing carbon, taxing carbon in some way.
This type of proposal has been tried in a few places, whether it’s Washington state where voters voted it down, you’ve had the Yellow Vest Movement, we had in Australia one party get rejected out of fear of the cost of climate change sort of being put on the backs of the consumer.
If pricing carbon is just politically impossible, how do we pay for climate mitigation?
Well, there is a variety of different ways to pay.
We talked about different ways of raising revenue.
And I think we’ve got to build our way out of this and grow our way out of this.
But let me just talk real quick to the previous question about real politics.
We could talk about climate, we could talk about guns, we could talk about all of these issues that we all care about.
We have a perception problem with the Democratic Party.
We are not connecting to the working class people in the very states that I represent in Ohio, in the industrial Midwest.
We’ve lost all connection.
We have got to change the center of gravity of the Democratic Party from being coastal and elital — elitist and Ivy League, which is the perception, to somebody from the forgotten communities that have been left behind for the last 30 years, to get those workers back on our side so we can say we’re going to build electric vehicles, we’re going to build solar panels.
But if you want to beat Mitch McConnell, this better be a working-class party.
If you want to go into Kentucky and take his rear end out, and if you want to take Lindsey Graham out, you’ve got to have a blue collar party that can go into the textile communities in South Carolina.
So all I’m saying here…
Thank you, Congressman Ryan.
All I’m saying here…
Thank you, Congressman Ryan.
So, Chuck, Chuck…
All I’m saying is here, if we don’t address that fundamental problem with our connection to workers — white, black, brown, gay, straight — working-class people…
Thank you, Congressman.
… none of this is going to get done, Chuck.
Thank you very much.
Chuck…
I want to you — we’re going to keep moving.
Congressman Delaney, I’m going to get to you…
This is — I introduced the only bipartisan carbon tax bill…
Thirty seconds — all right, 30 seconds, go.
This is really important.
All the economists agree that a carbon pricing mechanism works.
You just have to do it right.
You can’t put a price on carbon, raise energy prices, and not give the money back to the American people.
My proposal, which is put a price on carbon, give a dividend back to the American people.
It goes out one pocket, back in the other.
Thank you, Congressman.
I can get that passed my first year as president with a coalition of every Democrat in the Congress and the Republicans who live in coastal states.
Thank you.
Congressman, thank you.
Because Republicans in Florida, they actually care about this issue.
OK.
Thank you very much.
This has got to be our way forward if we’re actually serious about this issue.

I want to go down the line here, finish up .
It’s a simple question.
What is our — what is the biggest threat — what is — who is the geopolitical threat to the United States?
Just give me a one-word answer, Congressman Delaney.
Could you repeat the question?
Greatest geopolitical threat to the United States right now.
Congressman Delaney?
Well, the biggest geopolitical challenge is China.
But the biggest geopolitical threat remains nuclear weapons.
OK.
Right, so those are — you know, those are different questions.
I got you.
Totally get it.
Go ahead.
Governor Inslee?
The biggest threat to the security of the United States is Donald Trump.
And there’s no question about it.
Congresswoman Gabbard?
The greatest…
Greatest geopolitical threat.
The greatest threat that we face is the fact that we’re in a greater risk of nuclear war today than ever before in history.
Senator Klobuchar?
Two threats, economic threat, China, but our major threat right now is what’s going in the Mideast with Iran, if we don’t get…
OK, try to keep it at one — slimmer than what we’ve been going here.
One or two words.
Our existential threat is climate change.
We have to confront it before it’s too late.
Senator Warren?
Climate change.
Yeah.
Senator Booker?
Nuclear proliferation and climate change.
Secretary Castro?
China and climate change.
Congressman Ryan?
China, without a question.
They’re wiping us around the world economically.
And Mr. Mayor?
Russia, because they’re trying to undermine our democracy and they’ve been doing a pretty damn good job of it, and we need to stop them.
All right.
Well, thank you for that wide variety of answers, and I mean that.
No, I mean that in — that’s what this debate is about.
This is the best part of a debate like this.
Congressman O’Rourke, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report outlines multiple instances of potential criminal behavior by President Trump.
House Speaker Pelosi has publicly and privately resisted any move toward impeachment in the House.
If the House chooses not to impeach, as president, would you do anything to address the potential crimes that were outlined in Mr. Mueller’s report?

Thank you, Congressman O’Rourke.
Congressman Delaney, because of the accountability issues that Congressman O’Rourke was just describing there and the real political landscape in which Nancy Pelosi is saying that impeachment will not be pursued in the House, it raises the prospect — and the Mueller Report raises the prospect that President Trump could be prosecuted for some of those potential crimes down the line.
No U.S. president has ever been prosecuted for crimes after leaving office.
Do you believe that President Trump could or should be the first?
I guess there’s always a first.
Should he be?
I don’t think anyone is above the law.
I don’t think anyone is above the law, including a president.
I support Speaker Pelosi’s decisions that she is making in the House of Representatives right now as speaker.
I think she knows more about the decision as to whether to impeach the president than any of the 2020 candidates combined.
Conceded.
On the issue of prosecution…
So — but I do think — I do think the — no one is above the law, and this president, who is lawless, should not be above the law.
But I will tell you, Rachel, the one thing when you’re out doing as much campaigning as I’ve done, 400 events, all 99 counties in Iowa, this is not the number-one issue the American people ask us about.
It’s not.
They want to know what we’re going to do for health care, how we’re going to lower pharmaceutical prices, how we’re going to build infrastructure, what we’re going to do to create jobs in their communities.
You know, last year in our country, 80 percent of the money for start-up businesses went to 50 counties in this country.
There’s over 3,000 counties in this country.
That’s what they care about.
They care about what’s going on in the public schools.
They care about what’s going on with jobs in their communities, with their pay, with their health care, with infrastructure.
These are the issues, these kind of kitchen-table, pocket-book issues…
Understood.
… are actually what most Americans care about.
They never ask about the Mueller Report.
Congressman, thank you.
Your time is up.
They never ask about it.
They want to know how we’re going to solve these problems.
Your time’s…
Here’s the thing.
I still — Senator…
… but if we let the Republicans run our elections and if do not do something about Russian interference in the election and we let Mitch McConnell stop all the backup paper ballots, then we’re not going to get what we want to do.
I’ve got to sneak in — we blew through a break, which was good news, to give you more time, so I got to sneak one in now.
More of this debate.
It’s picking up here.
It continues right after this.

Before we do I want to say hello and good evening, Buenos noches to Mayor Buttigieg.
(UNTRANSLATED) Many of your colleagues on stage support free college.
You do not.
Why not?

Senator, your time is up.
I want to put that same question to Mayor Buttigieg.
Yeah, we’ve taught look, everybody who says Medicare for All, every person in politics who allows that phrase to escape their lips has a responsibility to explain how you’re actually supposed to get from here to there.
Now here’s how I would do it.
It’s very similar.
I would call it Medicare for All Who Want It. you take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, and you make it available on the exchanges it.
People can buy in.
and then if people like us are right that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single payer environment.
But, let’s remember even in countries that have outright socialized medicine, like England, even there there’s still a private sector, that’s fine.
It’s just that for our primary care we can’t be relying on the tender verses of the corporate system.
This one is very personal for me.
I started out this year dealing with a terminal illness of my father.
I make decisions for a living and nothing could have prepared me for the kind of decisions our family faced.
But, the thing we had going for us was that we never had to make those decisions based on whether it was gonna bankrupt our family because of Medicare.
And I want every–
–Time.
And I want every family to have that same freedom to do what is medically right, not (INAUDIBLE).
Your time is complete.
Vice President Biden, I want to put the question to you.
You were an ar–one of the architects of Obama Care.
So, where do we go from here?
Look, this is a very personal to me.
When my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident my two boys were really very badly injured.
I couldn’t imagine what it’d be like had I not had adequate healthcare available immediately.
And then when my son came home from Iraq after a year he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and he was given months to live.
I can’t fathom what would have happened if, in fact, they said by the way the last six months of your life you’re on your own.
We’re cutting off.
You’ve used up your time.
The fact of the matter is that the quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obama Care, to build on what we did.
And secondly, secondly, to make sure that everyone does have an option.
Everyone, whether they have private insurance, employer insurance or no insurance, they, in fact, can buy into the exchange to a Medicare like plan.
And the way you do that, you can do it quicker look, urgency matters.
There’s people right now facing what I’ve faced and what we’ve faced without any of the help I had.
We must move now.
I’m against any democrat who opposes–in fact–
–Vice President Biden, your time is–
–Takes down Obama Care and any republican who wants to get rid of it.
Let me–let me turn to Senator Sanders.
Senator Sanders, you have basically–you basically want to scrap the private health insurance system as we know it and replace it with a government run plan.
None of the states that have tried something like that, California, Vermont, New York has struggled with it, have been successful.
If politicians can’t make it work in those states how would you implement it on a national level.
How does this work?
Lester, I find it hard to believe that every other major country on earth, including my neighbor 50 miles north of me, Canada, somehow has figured out a way to provide healthcare to every man, woman and child, and in most cases they’re spending 50 percent per capita of what we are spending.
Let’s be clear, let us be very clear the function of healthcare today from the insurance and drug company perspective is not to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way.
The function of the healthcare system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies.
And, last year, if you could believe it, while we paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and I will lower prescription drug prices in half in this country, top ten companies made $69 billion in profit.
They will spend 100’s of millions of dollars lying to the American people telling us why we cannot have a–
–Senator–
–Medicare for All.
I just have to follow up there, how do you implement it on a national level.
I’m sorry?
How do you implement it on a national level given the fact that it’s not succeeded in other states that have tried?
I will tell you how we’ll do it.
We’ll do it the way real change has always taken place, whether it was the labor movement, the civil rights movement or the women’s movement.
We will have Medicare for all when tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up and tell the insurance companies and the drug companies that their day is gone, that healthcare is a human right, not something to make huge profits off of.
All right.
Ms. Williamson–Ms. Williamson this is a question for you.
Excuse me, excuse me.
I am addressing the question to Ms. Williamson.
We have been talking a lot about access to health insurance but for many Americans their most pressing concern is the high cost of healthcare.
How would you lower the cost of prescription drugs?
Well, first of all the government should never have made the deal with the big farm at that they couldn’t negotiate; that was just part of the regular corruption by which multinational corporations have their way with us.
You know I wanted to say that while I agree with–I–I’m with Senator Bennet and others but I agree with almost everything here I will tell you one thing it’s really nice if we got all these plans but if you think we are going to beat Donald Trump by just having all of these plans you’ve got another thing coming because he didn’t when by saying he had a plan.
He won by simply saying make America great again.
We’ve got to get deeper than just the superficial fixes as important as they are.
Even if we are just talking about the superficial fixes ladies and gentlemen we don’t have a health care system in the United States, we have a sickness care system in the United States.
We just wait until somebody gets sick and then we talk about who’s going to pay for the treatment and how they are going to be treated.
What we need to talk about is why so many Americans have unnecessary chronic illnesses so many more compared to other countries and that gets back into not just the big Pharma, not just health insurance companies, it has to do with chemical policies, it has to do with environmental policies–
All right, Ms. Williamson your time–
–it has to do with food policies– It has to do with drug policies.
Thank you.
It even has to do with environmental policies.
Thank you.
Senator–Senator Bennet, a question for you do you want to keep a system that we have in place with Obamacare and build on it?
You mentioned that a moment ago.
Is that enough to get us to universal coverage?
I believe that will get us the quickest way there and I bought the vice president was very moving about this andMayor Pete as well.
I had prostate cancer recently as you may know and that is why I was a little late getting in the race these same week my kid had her appendectomy out and I feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice.
I think that is what the American people want.
I believe it will get us there quickly.
There are millions of people in America that do not have health insurance today because they can’t–they are too wealthy.
Wealthy?
They make too much money to be on Medicaid, they can’t afford health insurance.
When Senator Sanders says that Canada is single payer, there are 35 million people in Canada.
There are 330 million people in the United States easily the number of people on a public option.
It could easily be 35 million and for them it would be Medicare for all as mayor Buttigieg says but for others that want to keep it they should be able to keep it.
And I think that will be the fastest way to get where we need to go.
Also I will say Bernie is a very honest person.
He has said over and over again unlike others that have supported this legislation over and over again that this will band making it illegal all insurance except cosmetic, except insurance for I guess that’s where plastic surgery.
Everything else is banned under the Medicare for all proposal–
I–I let–I let you go a little long there but I want–but obviously Senator Sanders you have got a response.
I would like to add a point here.
Senator Sanders (INAUDIBLE).
Just very briefly you know Mike, Medicare is the most popular–
I agree.
— Health insurance program in the country.
People don’t like their private insurance companies, they like their doctors and hospitals.
Under our plan people go to any doctor they want, any hospital they want.
We will substantially lower the cost of healthcare in this country because we will stop the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
On this issue–on this issue we have to think about how this affects real people–
(INAUDIBLE) lifetime, (INAUDIBLE) for all and today–
The reality of how this affects real people is captured in a story that many of us heard and I will para–paraphrase there is in the unite–America a parent who is seeing that their child has a temperature that is out of control, calls 911 what should I do and they say take the child to the emergency room and so they get in their car and they drive and there sitting in the parking lot outside of the emergency room looking at those sliding glass doors while they have the hand on the four head of their child knowing that if they walk through those sliding glass doors even though they have insurance they will be out 5000 deductible–$5000 deductible when they walk through those doors.
Senator, Senator–
That is what insurance companies are doing in America today.
We’re going to continue this discussion–
–I’m one of those parents–
I wanted to put it in–
Candidates, please.
I’m one of those parents.
I was just in the emergency room with my eight month old–
–Candidates, please–
–I’m one of those parents.
I was just in the emergency room.
And I’m telling you–
–Congressman, thank you–
–We fight health insurance companies every single week.
Thank you.
We stand in line and pay expensive prescription drugs.
We have to have a healthcare guarantee.
If you’re sick, you’re seen it.
And in America, you never go broke because of it.
Okay.
With all due respect–
–A lot of you have been talking tonight about these government healthcare plans that you proposed in one form or another.
This is a show of hands question.
And hold them up for a moment so people can see.
Raise your hand if–if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
Okay.
Let me start with you, Mayor Buttigieg.
Why?
Mayor Buttigieg, why?
Because our country is healthier when everybody is healthier.
And remember, we’re talking about something people are getting a–given a chance to buy into.
In the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes directly or indirectly.
This is not about a handout.
This is an insurance program.
And we do ourselves no favor by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access healthcare.
But of course, the real problem is we shouldn’t have 11 million undocumented people with no pathway to citizenship.
It makes no sense.
And the American people– The American people agree on what to do.
This is the crazy thing.
If leadership consists of–of forming a consensus around a divisive issue, this White House has divided us around a consensus issue.
The American people want a pathway to citizenship.
They wanted protections for Dreamers.
We need to clean up the lawful immigration system, like how my father immigrated to this country.
And as part of a compromise, we can do whatever commonsense measures are needed at the border.
Mayor–
–But Washington can’t deliver on something the American people want.
What does that tell you about the system we’re living in?
It tells you it needs profound–
–Mayor, thank you–
–Structural reform.
Vice President Biden, I believe you said that your– Health care plan would not cover undocumented immigrants.
Could you explain your position?
I’m sorry.
I beg your pardon.
I didn’t hear.
I believe at the show of hands you did not raise her hand.
Did you raise your hand?
Oh, no, I did.
I–but
–Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I–so, you said that they would be covered under your plan–
–Yes–
–Which is different than Obama Care.
Yes.
But here–here’s the thing.
Can you explain that change?
Yes.
You cannot let–as the mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered.
You can’t do that.
It’s just going to be taking care of, period.
You have to.
It’s the humane thing to do.
But here’s the deal.
The deal is that he’s right about three things.
Number one, they in fact contribute to the well-being of the country, but they also–for example, they’ve increased the lifespan of Social Security because they’re–they have a job.
They’re paying the Social Security tax.
That’s what they’re doing.
It’s increase the lifespan.
They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of healthcare by them being able to be treated and not wait until there in extremis.
The other thing is, folks, look, we can deal with these insurance companies.
We can deal with insurance companies by, number one, putting insurance executives in jail for their misleading–their misleading advertising, what they’re doing on opioids– –What they’re doing paying doctors to prescribe.
We should–we could be doing this by making sure everyone who is on Medicare–that the government should be able to negotiate the price for what–whatever the drug costs are.
We can do this by making sure that we’re in a position that we in fact allow people–you mean time’s up?
I just want to address–
–Your time’s up.
Vice President Biden, thank you.
Actually, you can hold off a minute.
We need to take a short break here.
We got a lot more we need to talk to all of you about, so stick with us.
We’re just getting started.
We’ll be back with more from Miami right after this.

Hickenlooper day one if you are–day one at the White House how do you respond?
With these–with these children?
Let me get to you in–in–in just a second.
I’m sorry.
Governor, day one, thousands of men, women and children cross the border asking for asylum for a better life.
What do you do?
One, day one, hour one?
Certainly the images we’ve seen this week just compound the emotional impact that the world is judging us by.
If you had ever told me any time in my life that this country would sanction federal agents to take children from the arms of their parents, put them in cages, actually put them up for adoption–in Colorado we call that kidnapping.
I–I would have called you– I would have told you it was unbelievable.
And the first thing we have to do is recognize the humanitarian crisis on the border for what it is and make sure there are the sufficient facil-facilities in place so that women and children are not separated from their families.
The children are with their families.
We have to make sure that–that ICE is completely reformed.
And they begin looking at their job in a humanitarian way where they are addressing the whole needs of the people that they are engaged with along the border.
And we have to make sure, ultimately, that we provide not just shelter, but food, clothing and access to medical care.
Ms. Williamson.
Yes, what Donald Trump has done to these children and it’s not just in Colorado, Governor, you’re right–it is kidnapping.
And it’s extremely important for us to realize that.
If you forcibly take a child from their parents arms you are kidnapping them.
And if you take a lot of children and you put them in a detainment center thus inflicting chronic trauma upon them that’s called child abuse.
This is collective child abuse.
This is collective child abuse.
And when this is crime–both of those things are a crime and if your government does it that doesn’t make it less of a crime.
These are state-sponsored crimes.
And what President–and what President Trump has done is not only attack these children, not only demonize these immigrants, he is attacking a basic principle of America’s moral core.
We open our hearts to the stranger.
This is extremely important and it’s also important for all of us remember and I have great respect for everyone who is on this–on this–on this stage but we are going to talk about what to do about healthcare.
Well, where have you been guys?
Because if it’s not just the matter of a plan and I haven’t heard anybody on this stage who has talked about American  in Latin America and how we might have in the last few decades contributed to something being more helpful(SP).
Senator Gillibrand what would you do as President with a reality?
Well, one of the worst things about President Trump that he has done to this country is he has torn apart the moral fabric of who we are.
When he started separating children at the border from their parents the fact that seven children have died in his custody, the fact that dozens of children have been separated from their parents and they have no plan to reunite them so I would do a few things.
First, I would fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship.
Second, I would reform how we treat asylum-seekers at the border.
I would have a community-based treatment center where you are doing it within the communities where asylum-seekers are given lawyers, where there is real immigration judges, not employees of the Atty.
Gen.
but appointed for life and have a community-based system.
I would fund borders security but the worst thing President Trump has done is he has diverted the funds away from cross-border terrorism, cross-border human trafficking, drug trafficking and gun trafficking and he is given that money to the for-profit prisons.
I would not be spending money in for profit prisons–
We had–
–to lock up children and asylum-seekers.
We had a very spirited debate on this stage last night on the topic of decriminalization of the border.
If–if you would be so kind raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross the border without documentation?
Can we keep the hands up so we can see them?
Let’s remember that’s not just a theoretical exercise, that criminalization that is the basis for family separation.
You do away with that it is no longer possible.
Of course it wouldn’t be possible anyway in my presidency because it is dead wrong.
We have got to talk about one other thing because the Republican Party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion.
Now our party doesn’t talk about that as much largely for a very good reason which was we are committed to the separation of church and state and we stand for people of any religion and people of no religion.
But we should call out hypocrisy when we see it in for a party that associates itself with Christianity to say that it is okay to suggest that God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents, that God would condone putting children in cages has lost all claim to ever use religious language again.
Mr. vice president I don’t know if you raised your hand or word just asking to speak–
Look–
Would you decriminalize crossing the border without documents?
The first thing I would do is unite families.
I would surge immediately billions of dollars’ worth of help to the region the immediately.
Look, I talk about .
I am the guy that got a bipartisan agreement at the very end of the campaign, at the very end of our term to spend $740 million to deal with the problem and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place.
It was working.
We saw as you know a net decrease in the number of children who were coming.
The crisis was updated and along came this President and he said he immediately discontinued that.
We all talk about these things, I did it.
I did it.
740–now look, second thing–second thing we have to do, the law now requires the reuniting of those families.
We would reunite those families period and if not we would put those children in a circumstance where they were safe until we could find their parents.
And lastly the idea that he is in court with his Justice Department saying children in cages do not need a bed, do not need a blanket, do not need a toothbrush–
Vice President–
That is outrageous.
The Obama-Biden administration was– The Obama-Biden administration deported more than three million Americans.
My question to you is if an individual is living in the United States of America without documents and that is his only offense, should that person be deported?
Depending if they committed a–a major crime, they should be deported.
And the President was left in his–President Obama I think did a heck of a job.
To compare him to what–what this guy is doing is absolutely, I find–close to immoral.
But the fact is that, look, we should not be locking people up.
We should be making sure we change the circumstance, as we did, why they would leave in the first place.
And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them, keep them safe until they can be heard.
A 15-second, if you could, if you wish to answer, should someone who is here without documents, and that is his only offense, should that person be deported?
That person should not be the focus of deportation.
We should fundamentally change the way we deal with things.
Senator?
I want to–
–I think it’s important–
–Suggest that I agree with a lot of what Kamala just said, and that is on day one we take out our executive order pen and we rescind every damn thing on this issue that Trump has done.
Number two–number two, picking up on the point that Joe made, we got a look at the root causes.
And you have a situation where Honduras, among other things, is a failing state, massive corruption.
You got gangs who are telling families that if a 10-year-old does not join their gang, their family is going to be killed.
What we have got to do on day one and invite the presidents and the leadership of Central America and Mexico together.
This is a hemispheric–
–Thank you–
–Problem that we have got to address.
Congressman Swalwell?
What do you do?
Day one?
No. If someone is here without documents and that is their only offense, is that person to be deported?
No, that person can be a part of this great American experience.
That person can contribute.
My congressional district is one of the most diverse in America, and we see the benefits when people contribute and they become a part of the community and they’re not in the shadow economy.
Day one for me, families are reunited.
This president, though, for immigrants, there is nothing he will not do two separate a family, cage a child, or erase their existence by weaponizing the census.
And there is nothing that we cannot do in the courts and that I will not do as president to reverse that and to make sure that families always belong together.
Senator Harris?
Well, thank you.
I will say, no, absolutely not.
They should not be deported.
And I actually–this was one of the very few issues with which I disagreed with the administration, with whom I otherwise had a great relationship and a great deal of respect.
But on the secure communities issue, I was Attorney General of California.
I led the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, in a state of 40 million people.
And on this issue, I disagreed with my president, because the policy was to allow deportation of people who, by ICE’s own definition, were non-criminals.
So, as Attorney General and the chief law officer of the state of California, I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state that they did not have to comply with detainers and instead should make decisions based on the best interest of public safety of their community.
Because what I saw–and I was tracking it every day.
I was tracking it and saw that–that parents, people who had not committed a crime even by ICE’s own definition, were being deported.
And–but I have to add a point here.
The problem with this kind of policy, and I know it as a prosecutor–
–Senator–
–I want a rape victim to be able to run in the middle–
–Senator–
–Of a–to run in the middle of the street and waved down a police officer and report the crime against her.
I want anybody who has been the victim–
–Senator–
–Of any real crime–
–Senator–
–To be able to do that–
–Your time–
–And not be afraid that, if they do that–
–Senator–
–They will be deported because the abuser–
–Senator–
–Will tell them it is they who is the criminal.
It is wrong.
We’re going to turn–
–It is wrong–
–We’re going to turn to the issue of trade now, if we can.
Last night we ask the candidates on this stage to name the greatest geopolitical threat facing the U.S. Four of them mentioned China.
U.S. businesses say China steals our intellectual property and party leaders on both sides accuse China of manipulating their currency to keep the cost of goods artificially low.
I’ll ask this to Senator Bennet to start off with, how would you stand up to China?
I think that, first of all, the biggest–the biggest threat to our national security right now is Russia, not China.
And, second, on China we’ve got comp–because of what they’ve done with our election.
In China, I think the president’s been right to push back on China but he’s done it in completely the wrong way.
We should mobilize the entire rest of the world who all have a shared interest in pushing back on China’s mercantilist trade policies and I think we can do that.
I’d like to answer the other question before this as well.
You–you have the time–
When I–when I–when I see these kids at the border, I see my mom because I know she sees herself because she was separated from her parents for years during the holocaust in Poland.
And for Donald Trump to be doing what he’s doing to children and their families at the borders I say this as somebody who wrote the immigration bill in 2013 that created a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people in this country that had the most progressive DREAM Act that’s ever been conceived, much less passed, it got 68 votes in the Senate, that had $46 billion of border security in it that was sophisticated 21st century border security, not a medieval wall that the president has–
–Senator, the time–sorry–
–Turned the border of the United States into a symbol of nativist hostility that the whole world is looking at when what we should be represented by is–
–Senator, thank you.
–The Statue of Liberty, which has brought my parents to this country to begin with.
We need to make a change.

Mm-hmm.
But, I also believe–and it’s personal.
And I–I was actually very–it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on segregation of race in this country.
And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose bussing.
And you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bussed to school every day and that little girl was me.
So, I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among democrats.
We have to take it seriously.
We have to act swiftly.
As attorney general of California, I was very proud to put in place a–a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on.
Senator Harris, thank you.
Vice President Biden, you have been invoked.
We are going to give you a chance to respond.
That’s a mischaracterization of my position across the board.
I did not praise racists.
That is not true, number one.
Number two, if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether I did or not, I’m happy to do that.
I was a public defender.
I didn’t become a prosecutor.
I came out and I left a good law firm to become a public defender when in fact — when in fact — when in fact my city was in flames because of the–the assassination of Dr. King, number one.
Now, number two, as the U.S.–as–excuse me–as the vice president of the United States, I worked with a man who in fact, we worked very hard to see to it we dealt with these issues in a major, major way.
The fact is that in terms of busing, the busing, I never–you would’ve been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council.
That’s fine.
That’s one of the things I argued for that we should not be–we should be breaking down these lines.
But–so, the bottom line here is, look, everything I have done in my career–I ran because of civil rights.
I continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights.
And those civil rights, by the way, include not just African Americans, but the LGBT community.
They don’t–
–But, Vice President Biden do you agree today–do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then?
No.
Do you agree?
I did not oppose bussing in America.
What I opposed is bussing ordered by the Department of Education.
That’s what I opposed.
I did not oppose–
–Well, there was a failure of–of states to–to integrate–
–No, but–
–Public schools in America.
I was part of the second class to integrate, Berkley, California Public Schools almost two decades after Brown v.
Board of Education.
Because your city council made that decision.
It was a local decision.
So, that’s where the federal government must step in.
The–the federal government must–
–That’s why we have the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act.
That’s why we need to pass the Equality Act.
That’s why we need to pass the ERA because there are–
–That–
–Moments in-
–history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people.
I have supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran for (INAUDIBLE).
Vice President Biden 30 seconds because I want to bring other people into this.\
I–I supported the ERA from the very beginning.
I am the guy that extended the voting rights act for 25 years.
We got to the place where we got 98 out of 98 votes in the United States Senate doing it.
I have also argued very strongly that we in fact deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box.
I agree that everybody once they in fact–my time is up.
I’m sorry.
Thank you vice president.
All of these things (INAUDIBLE).

We’re going to sneak in a break in a minute, but before we go, I’m going to go down the line here and I’m asking you please, for one or two words.
All right?
Please.
Really.
President Obama, in his first year, wanted to address both healthcare and climate and he could only get one signature issue accomplished.
It was, obviously, healthcare.
He didn’t get to do climate change.
You may only get one shot and your first issue that you’re going to push–you get one shot that it may be the only thing you get passed, what is that first issue for your presidency?
Eric Swalwell, you’re first.
For Parkland, for Orlando, for every community effected by gun violence, ending gun violence.
Senator Bennet?
Climate change and the lack of economic mobility Bernie talks about.
Senator Gillibrand?
Passing a family bill of rights that includes a national paid leave plan, universal Pre-K, affordable daycare and making sure that women and families can thrive in the workplace no matter who they are.
All right.
Oh, I like that.
Senator Harris?
So, passing a middle class and working families tax cut.
That’s one.
DACA, guns.
I’ll give you credit for the first thing you said, the tax cut.
Senator Sanders, first thing?
The premise that there’s only one or two issues out there.
I’m not saying there’s only one or two.
is enormous crisis.
Senator Sanders–
–We need a political revolution.
People have got to stand up and take on the special interests.
We can transform this country.
Vice President Biden, your first issue, Mr. Vice President?
I think you’ve so underestimated what Barack Obama did.
He’s the first man to bring together the entire world, 196 nations to commit to deal with climate change immediately.
I don’t–I don’t buy that.
The first–the first thing I would do is make sure that we defeat Donald Trump.
Okay.
Period.
Mayor Buttigieg, your first priority, your first issue as president that you are going to block and tackle?
We’ve got to fix our democracy before it’s too late.
Get that right and climate, immigration, taxes and every other issue gets better.
Mr.–Mr. Yang?
I would pass a $1,000 freedom dividend for every American adult starting at age 18.
Which would speed us up on climate change because if you get the boot off of people’s throats they’re (INAUDIBLE) climate change much more clearly.
Okay.
Governor Hickenlooper?
I would do a collaborative approach to climate change and I would pronounce it well before the election to make sure we don’t reelect the worst president in American history.
And Ms. Williamson, you have the last word.
My first call is to Prime Minister of New Zealand who said that her role is to make New Zealand the place where it’s the best place in the world for a child to grow up.
And I would tell her, girlfriend, you are so wrong because the United States of America is going to be the best place–
Thank you.
–In the world for a child to grow up.
We are going to have–
–Thank you.
You guys were close with the short–at least it was shorter.
No, they weren’t, not at all.
All right, C-minus.

Well, first, the economy.
We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity.
And Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what’s going on, when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums.
So I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids.
I do.
But I think my plan is a good one.
And my plan would be to, first of all, make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education.
My own dad and my sister got their first degrees with community college.
There’s many paths to success, as well as certifications.
Secondly, I’d used Pell grants.
I’d double them from $6,000 to $12,000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered, to families that make up to $100,000.
And then the third thing I would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans.
Because I can tell you this: If billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.
	
This economy has got to work for everyone.
And right now, we know that it isn’t.
And it’s going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does.
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Right now, we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes.
That’s how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest.
A $2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality.
A new democracy that is revived because we’ve returned power to the people, no PACs, no gerrymandering, automatic and same-day voter registration to bring in more voters, and a new Voting Rights Act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now…
Congressman O’Rourke…
That’s how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody.
Congressman, that’s time, sir.
I’ll give you 10 seconds to answer if you want to answer the direct question.
Would you support a 70 percent individual marginal tax rate?
Yes, no, or pass?
I would support a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone.
Tax capital at the same right…
Seventy percent?
… that you — you tax ordinary income.
Take that corporate tax rate up to 28 percent.
You would generate the revenues…
OK, that’s time.
… you need to pay for the programs we’re talking about.

I don’t think I disagree.
I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation.
And you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from labor, and we have people that work full-time jobs and still can’t make a living wage.
We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs.
And you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that’s hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete.
One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector.
So I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work.
And I’ll tell you this.
I live in a low-income black and brown community.
I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans.
The indicators that are being used, from GDP to Wall Street’s rankings, is not helping people in my community.
It is about time that we have an economy that works for everybody, not just the wealthiest in our nation.
But quickly, Senator Booker, you did say that you didn’t think it was right to name names, to name companies and single them out, as Senator Warren has.
Briefly, why is that?
Well, again, I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that.
And when it comes to antitrust law, what I will do is, number one, appoint judges that will enforce it, number two, have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration.
At the end of the day, we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing.
We see that with everything from Citizens United and the way they’re trying to influence Washington.
It’s about time that we have a president that fights for the people in this country…
That’s time, sir.
We need to have someone that’s a champion for them.
Thank you, Senator.
Senator Warren, I mentioned you … Are you picking winners and losers?
So the way I understand this, it’s there is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country.
That hurts workers.
It hurts small businesses.
It hurts independent farmers.
It hurts our economy overall.
And it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy.
Now, look, we’ve had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back.
What’s been missing is courage, courage in Washington to take on the giants.
That’s part of the corruption in this system.
It has been far too long that the monopolies have been making the campaign contributions, have been funding the super PACs, have been out there making sure that their influence is heard and felt in every single decision that gets made in Washington.
Where I want to start this is I want to return government to the people, and that means calling out the names of the monopolists and saying I have the courage to go after them.

Thank you very much for that question, Lester.
You know, I grew up with a mother who raised my brother, Joaquin, and me as a single parent.
And I know what it’s like to struggle.
I know what it’s like to rent a home and to worry about whether you’re going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month and to see a mom work very, very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because they’re women.
I would do several things, starting with something we should have done a long time ago, which is to pass the Equal Rights Amendment finally in this country.
And also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country.
It’s past time that we did that.
And, you know, we have to do this.
If we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century, we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve.
All right, thank you.
I want to put the same question to Congresswoman Gabbard.
Your thoughts on equal pay?

Well, we’ve been addressing income inequality in New York City by raising wages, by raising benefits, by putting money back in the hands of working people, $15 minimum wage, paid sick days, pre-K for all, things that are making a huge difference in working people’s lives.
But let me tell you, what we’re hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle for the heart and soul of our party.
I want to make it clear.
This is supposed to be the party of working people.
Yes, we’re supposed to be for a 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy.
Yes, we’re supposed to be for free college, free public college, for our young people.
We are supposed to break up big corporations when they’re not serving our democracy.
This Democratic Party has to be strong and bold and progressive.
And in New York, we’ve proven that we can do something very different, we can put money back in the hands of working people.
And let me tell you, every time you talk about investing in people and their communities, you hear folks say there’s not enough money.
What I say to them every single time is, there’s plenty of money in this world, there’s plenty of money in this country.
It’s just in the wrong hands.
Democrats have to fix that.
(APPLAUSE)
Congressman Delaney, do you agree?
I think we have to do real things to help American workers and the American people.
Right?
This is the issue that all of us hear on the campaign trail.
We need to make sure everyone has a living wage.
And I’ve called for a doubling of the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating paid family leave.
That will create a situation where people actually have a living wage.
That gets right to workers.
Then we’ve got to fix our public education system.
It’s not delivering the results our kids needs, nor is college and post high school career and technical training programs doing that.
You know, I’m very different than everyone else here on the stage.
Prior to being in Congress, I was an entrepreneur.
I started two businesses.
I created thousands of jobs.
I spent my whole career helping small- to mid-sized businesses all over the country, 5,000 of them I supported.
The Obama administration gave me an award for lending to disadvantaged communities.
I know how to create jobs.
We need a short-term strategy which is to put money in the pockets of workers with the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating family leave, and then we need to have a long-term strategy to make sure this country is competitive and we’re creating jobs everywhere in this country.
Thank you.
Governor Inslee, how would you address income inequality?
Yes, I believe you can, but, first, let’s say the president came, he said don’t sell your house to people in Youngstown, Ohio.
And then his administration just in the last two years, we lost $4,000 — 4,000 jobs at a General Motors facility.
That rippled throughout our community.
General Motors got a tax cut.
General Motors got a bailout.
And then they have the audacity to move a new car that they’re going to produce to Mexico.
I’ve had family members that have to unbolt a machine from the factory floor, put it in a box, and ship it to China.
My area where I come from in northeast Ohio, this issue we’re talking about here, it’s been going on 40 years.
This is not a new phenomenon in the United States of America.
The bottom 60 percent haven’t seen a raise since 1980.
Meanwhile, the top 1 percent control 90 percent of the wealth.
We need an industrial policy saying we’re going to dominate building electric vehicles, there’s going to be 30 million made in the next 10 years.
I want half of them made in the United States.
I want to dominate the solar industry…
Thank you.
… and manufacture those here in the United States.
Senator Warren, are they coming back?
Are these jobs coming back?
So we’ve had an industrial policy in the United States for decades now, and it’s basically been let giant corporations do whatever they want to do.
Giant corporations have exactly one loyalty, and that is to profits.
And if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to Canada, they’re going to do it.
So here’s what I propose for an industrial policy.
Start with a place where there’s a real need.
There’s going to be a worldwide need for green technology, ways to clean up the air, ways to clean up the water.
And we can be the ones to provide that.
We need to go tenfold in our research and development on green energy going forward.
And then we need to say any corporation can come and use that research.
They can make all kinds of products from it, but they have to be manufactured right here in the United States of America.
And then we have to double down and sell it around the world.
There’s a $23 trillion market coming for green products.
We should be the leaders and the owners, and we should have that 1.2 million manufacturing jobs here in America.
Thank you.

Well, I think it’s a bold approach.
It’s something that Barack Obama wanted to do when we were working on the Affordable Care Act.
And that is a public option.
I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in four years, which is exactly what this bill says.
So let me go on beyond that.
There is a much bigger issue in addition to that, and that is pharmaceuticals.
The president literally went on TV, on Fox, and said that people’s heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices.
Instead, 2,500 drugs have gone up in double-digits since he came into office.
Instead, he gave $100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies.
For the rest of us, for the rest of America, that’s what we call at home all foam and no beer.
We got nothing out of it.
And so my proposal is to do something about pharma, to take them on, to allow negotiation under Medicare, to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries.
And pharma thinks they own Washington?
Well, they don’t own me.
Your time is up.
Thank you.
Senator Warren, you signed on to Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for all plan.
It would put essentially everybody on Medicare and then eliminate private plans that offer similar coverage.
Is that the plan or path that you would pursue as president?
So, yes.
I’m with Bernie on Medicare for all.
And let me tell you why.
I spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke.
And one of the number-one reasons is the cost of health care, medical bills.
And that’s not just for people who don’t have insurance.
It’s for people who have insurance.
Look at the business model of an insurance company.
It’s to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your health care.
That leaves families with rising premiums, rising copays, and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the health care that their doctors say that they and their children need.
Medicare for all solves that problem.
And I understand.
There are a lot of politicians who say, oh, it’s just not possible, we just can’t do it, have a lot of political reasons for this.
What they’re really telling you is they just won’t fight for it.
Well, health care is a basic human right, and I will fight for basic human rights…
Congressman O’Rourke, when you ran for Senate, you also praised a bill that would replace private insurance.
This year, you’re saying you’re no longer sure.
Can you explain why?
My goal is to ensure that every American is well enough to live to their full potential because they have health care.
In Laredo, Texas, I met a young man, 27 years old, told me that he’d been to a doctor once in his life.
And on that visit, he was told he had diabetes, he was told he had glaucoma, and he was told untreated — because he doesn’t have health care — he’ll be dead before the age of 40.
So getting to guaranteed, high-quality, universal health care as quickly and surely as possible has to be our goal.
The ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider, to be — the ability to see a mental health care provider.
In Texas, the single largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system today.
And health care also has to mean that every woman can make her own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible.
Our plan says that if you’re uninsured, we enroll you in Medicare.
If you’re insufficiently insured, you can’t afford your premiums, we enroll you in Medicare.
But if you’re a member of a union that negotiated for a health care plan that you like because it works for you and your family, you’re able to keep it.
Your time is up.
We preserve choice by making sure everybody has care.
Your time is up, Congressman, but I do want to ask a follow-up on this.
Just to be very clear — I’ll give you 10 seconds — would you replace private insurance?
No. I think the choice is fundamental to our ability to get everybody cared for…
Wait, wait, wait.
Congressman O’Rourke, Congressman O’Rourke, private insurance is not working for tens of millions of Americans when you talk about the co-pays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out of pocket expenses.
It’s not working.
How can you defend a system that’s not working?
That’s right.
So for those for whom it’s not working, they can choose Medicare.
For the…
Congressman…
… who I listen to…
… you’ve got to start by acknowledging the system is not working for people.
… they’re able to keep them.
Why are you defending private insurance to begin with?
… 100 million Americans say they like their private health insurance, by the way.
It should be noted that 100 million Americans — I mean, I think we should be the party that keeps what’s working and fixes what’s broken.
I mean, doesn’t that make sense?
I mean, we should give everyone in this country health care as a basic human right for free, full stop.
But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance.
Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people?
And also it’s bad policy.
If you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question, which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate?
Every single hospital administrator said they would close.
And the Medicare for all bill requires payments to stay at current Medicare rates.
So to some extent, we’re supporting a bill that will have every hospital closing.
I mean, my dad was a union electrician, right?
I actually grew up in a working-class family.
He loved the health care that the IBEW gave him.
And I just always think about my dad in anything I would do from a policy perspective.
He’d look at me and he’d say, good job, John, for getting health care for every American.
But why are you taking my health care away?
I’ve let this — I’ve let this play out a little bit because I’m fascinated to hear the daylight between you.
Congresswoman Gabbard, why don’t you weigh in here?
I think we’re talking about this in the wrong way.
You’re talking about one bill over another bill.
Really, what we’re talking about is our objective, making sure that every single sick American in this country is able to get the health care that they need.
I believe Medicare for all is the way to do that.
I also think that employers will recognize how much money will be saved by supporting a Medicare for all program, a program that will reduce the administrative costs, reduce the bureaucratic costs, and make sure that everyone gets that quality health care that they need.
I also think that…
Senator…
… if you — if you look at other countries in the world who have universal health care, every one of them has some form of a role of private insurance, so I think that’s what we’ve got to look at, taking the best of these ideas, but making sure unequivocally that no sick American goes without getting the care that they need, regardless of how much or little money they have in their pocket.
Congresswoman, Congresswoman, thanks.
Let me turn to Senator Booker on this.
Senator Booker, explain to me where you are.
This is hugely important to people.
So tell us where you are.
I absolutely will.
First of all, we’re talking about this as a health care issue, but in communities like mine, low-income communities, it’s an education issue, because kids who don’t have health care are not going to succeed in school.
It is an issue for jobs and employment, because people who do not have good health care do not succeed at work.
It’s even a retirement issue, because in my community, African-Americans have a lower life expectancy because of poorer health care.
And so where I stand is very clear.
Health care — it’s not just a human right, it should be an American right.
And I believe the best way to get there is Medicare for all.
But I have an urgency about this.
When I am president of the United States, I’m not going to wait.
We have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care.
And on this debate, I’m sorry.
There are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America, from pharmaceutical companies to insurers.
Literally, the overhead for insurance that they charge is 15 percent, while Medicare’s overhead is only at 2 percent.
We can do this better.
And every single day, I will be fighting to give people more access and more affordable costs until we get to my goal…
Your time is up, Senator.
… which is every American having health care.
Time is up, Senator.
I want to…
I want to move back, if I can, to Congresswoman Gabbard…
… point, though, and that is that the insurance companies last year alone sucked $23 billion in profits out of the health care system, $23 billion.

It should not be an option in the United States of America for any insurance company to deny a woman coverage for their exercise of their right of choice.
And I am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a woman’s right of reproductive health in health insurance, and I’m the only candidate who has passed a public option.
And I respect everybody’s goals and plans here, but we do have one candidate that’s actually advanced the ball.
And we’ve got to have access for everyone.
I’ve done it as a public option.
They should absolutely be held criminally liable, because they are liable and responsible.
This is one of the reasons why well before I was running for president I said I would not take contributions from pharma companies, not take contributions from corporate PACs, or pharma executives, because they are part of this problem.
And this opioid addiction in our country, we in cities like mine have been seeing how we’ve tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long.
It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that.
Thank you very much, Jose.
I’m very proud that in April I became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan.
And we saw those images… … watching that image of Oscar and his daughter, Valeria, is heartbreaking.
It should also piss us all off.
If I were president today — and it should spur us to action.
If I were president today, I would sign an executive order that would get rid of Trump’s zero-tolerance policy, the remain in Mexico policy, and the metering policy — this metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river.
They had been playing games with people who are coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry.
Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry, and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim, so they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river, and they died because of that.
May I address that?
First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal.
And one of the reasons why we’re seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation.
Literally, he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years.
And now we see Iran threatening to go further and who are pulled — being pulled further and further into this crisis.
We need to renegotiate and get back into a deal, but I’m not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally I’m going to rejoin that deal.
Because when I’m president of the United States, I’m going to do the best I can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if I have an opportunity to leverage a better deal, I’m going to do it.
I’m going to use 20 of my seconds just to say there’s one thing we don’t all agree with when it comes to guns, and I think it’s common sense, and over 70 percent of Americans agree with me.
If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to buy and own a firearm.
And not everybody in this field agrees with that.
But in states like Connecticut that did that, they saw 40 percent drops in gun violence and 15 percent drops in suicides.
We need to start having bold agendas on guns.
When it comes to the Supreme Court, very clearly, we — I agree with my friend, Secretary Castro.
We are going to get to 50 votes in the Senate.
This is a team sport.
Whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like South Carolina, because we can elect Jamie Harrison.
They need to campaign in places like Iowa, because we can win a Senate seat there.
This is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the Senate and more so that we cannot only balance the Supreme Court, but start to pass an aggressive agenda that, frankly, isn’t so aggressive, because most of America agrees with the policy objectives of our party.
Let me say that there is no one in our government at any level who has the right to tell any American who they should be allowed to love or who they should be allowed to marry.
My record in Congress for over six years shows my commitment to fighting for LGBTQ equality.
I serve on the Equality Caucus and recently voted for passage of the Equality Act.
Maybe many people in this country can relate to the fact that I grew up in a socially conservative home, held views when I was very young that I no longer hold today.
I’ve served with LGBTQ servicemembers, both in training and deployed downrange.
I know that they would give their life for me and I would give my life for them.
It is this commitment that I’ll carry through as president of the United States, recognizing that there are still people who are facing discrimination in the workplace, still people who are unable to find a home for their families.
It is this kind of discrimination that we need to address.
John, appreciate the question.
The answer is yes, but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends.
When the United States presents a united front, we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer, the kind of genocide that we saw in Rwanda, the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward.
But unfortunately, under this administration, President Trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances.
He’s diminished our standing in the world and he’s made us weaker as a country, less able to confront challenges, whether it’s Iran or North Korea or Vladimir Putin in Russia, who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016, and who President Trump has offered another invitation to do the same.
He’s embraced strongmen and dictators at the expense of the great democracies.
As president, I will make sure that we live our values in our foreign policy.
I will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together.
That makes America stronger.
Well, you are quite right.
We have a new vision for America and at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America, while 500,000 people are sleeping out on the streets today we think it is time for change, real change.
And by that I mean that healthcare in my view is a human right and we have got to pass a Medicare for all single-payer system.
Under that system by the way vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now.
I believe that education is the future for this country and that is why I believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition-free and eliminate student debt and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street.
Every proposal that I have brought forth is fully paid for.
What I meant by that is look, Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America.
Ordinary middle-class Americans built America.
My dad used to have an expression he said Joe a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it’s about your dignity, it’s about respect, it’s being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything’s going to be okay.
Too many people who are in the middle class and poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal.
What I am saying is that we’ve got to be straightforward.
We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it.
They have to make sure that we (INAUDIBLE) situation where there’s continuing education and they are able to pay for it and they have to make sure that they are able to breathe air that is–is–is clean and they–they have water that they can drink.
Look, Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation.
We do have enormous income inequality and one thing I agree honestly can make massive cuts in the $1.6 trillion in tax loopholes out there and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy.
Well, let me tell you something.
I–I hear that question, but where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that–that benefits the top 1 percent and—the biggest corporations in the–this country, contributing at least a–$1 trillion to the debt of America, which middle-class families will pay for one way or another.
Working families need support and need to be lifted up, and frankly this economy is not working or working people.
For too long, the rules have been written in the favor of the people who have the most and not in favor of the people who work the most, which why I am proposing that we change the tax code so, for every family that is making less than $100,000 year, they will receive a tax credit that they can collect, up to $500 a month, which will make all the difference between those families being able to get through the end of the month with dignity and was support or not.
And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill that benefits the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in America.
Well, I think that the bottom line is, if we don’t clearly define that we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way they can and–and call us socialists.
And if you look at the Green New Deal, which I admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change, I’m a scientist, but we can’t promise every American a government job if you want to get universal healthcare coverage.
I believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege, but you can’t expect to eliminate private insurance for 180 million people, many of whom don’t want to give it up.
In Colorado, we brought businesses and nonprofits together.
We got to near universal healthcare coverage.
We were the first state in America to–to bring the environmental community and the oil and gas industry to address, aggressively address methane emissions.
And we were also the first place to–to expand reproductive rights on a scale basis that we reduced teen pregnancy by 54 percent.
We’ve done the big progressive things people said it couldn’t be done.
I’ve done what pretty much everyone else up here is still talking about doing.
I got $100,000 in student loan debt myself.
I tell you–if I count on the people who have been in government for the past 30 years who were around when this problem was created to be the ones to solve it it is going to be the next generation, the 40 million of us who can’t start a family.
Can’t take a good idea and start a business and can’t buy our first home.
This is the generation that’s going to be able to solve student loan debt.
This generation is ready to lead.
Hey, guys.
You know what?
America does not want to witness a food fight.
They want to know how we’re going to put food on their table.
So, on that point, part of the issue that is at play in America today, and we’ve all been traveling around the country, I certainly have, I’m meeting people who are working two and three jobs.
You know, this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy, right?
My great economy.
My great economy.
You ask him, well, how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours and he talks about the stock market.
Well, that’s fine if you own stocks.
So many families in America do not.
You ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers.
Well, yeah, people in America are working.
They’re working two and three jobs.
So, when we talk about jobs, let’s be very clear.
In our America, no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table.
Well, I just want to agree that I think Russia is our biggest geopolitical threat because they’ve been hacking our democracy successfully.
They’ve been laughing their asses off about it for the last couple of years and we should focus on that before we start worrying about other threats.
Now, China, they do–they do (INAUDIBLE) property.
It’s a massive problem.
But the tariffs and the trade war are just punishing businesses and producers and workers on both sides.
I met with a farmer in Iowa who said he spent six years building up a buying relationship in China that’s now disappeared and gone forever.
And the beneficiaries have not been American workers or–or people in China.
It’s been Southeast Asia and other producers that have then stepped into the void.
So, we need to–to crack down on Chinese malfeasance in the trade relationship but the tariffs and the trade war are the wrong way to go.
Because I couldn’t get it done.
My community is in anguish right now because of an officer involved shooting.
A black man Eric Logan killed by a white officer.
And I’m not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back.
The officer says he was attacked with a knife, but he didn’t have his body camera on.
It’s a mess.
And we’re hurting.
And I could walk you through all of the things that we have done as a community–all of the steps that we took from bias training to de-escalation but it didn’t save the life of Eric Logan.
And when I look into his mother’s eyes I have to face the fact and nothing that I say will bring him back.
This is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country.
And until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism whatever this particular incident teaches us we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that there is a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time.
Not just from what has happened in the past but what’s happening around the country in the present.
It threatens the well being of every community.
And I am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle when they see a police officer approaching feels the exact same thing.
A feeling not of fear but of safety.
I’m determined to bring that day about.
No, absolutely not.
Unlike the Republican party we encourage diverse city, we believe in diverse city, that is what America is up about.
But in addition to diversity in terms of having more women, more people from the GB–L–LGBT community we also have to do something else and that is we have to ask ourselves a simple question and that how come to day the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1 percent has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth.
We need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interest who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.
Gridlock will not magically disappear as long as Mitch McConnell is there, first.
Second, second, that is why it is so important for us to when not just the presidency to have somebody that can run in all 50 states but to–but to win the Senate as well and that is why we have to propose policies that can be supported like Medicare X (PH) so that we can build a broad coalition of Americans to overcome broken Washington DC.
I agree with what Senator Gillibrand was saying and share a lot of her views.
We need to in gerrymandering in wash–and we need to end political gerrymandering in Washington.
The court today said they couldn’t do anything about it.
We need to overturn Citizens United.
The court was the one that gave us Citizens United.
And the attack on voting rights in Shelby versus Holder is something we need to deal with.
All of those things has happened since Vice President Biden was in the Senate.
And we face structural problems that we have to overcome with a broad coalition.
It’s the only way we can do it.
We need to root out the corruption in Washington, expand people’s right to get to the polls.
Well, my plan is somebody who believes, for a start, that a woman’s right to control her own body is a constitutional right, that government and politicians should not infringe on that right.
We will do everything we can to defense our–Roe versus Wade.
Second of all, let me make– –Let me make–let me make a promise here.
You asked about litmus test.
My litmus test is I will never appoint any–nominate any justice to the Supreme Court unless that justice is 100 percent clear he or she will defend Roe v.
Wade.
Third of all, I do not believe in packing the court.
Well, first of all I don’t even call it climate change.
It’s a climate crisis.
It represents an existential threat to us as a species.
And the fact that we have a President of the United States who has embraced science fiction over science fact will be to our collective peril.
I visited while the embers were smoldering the wildfires in California I spoke with firefighters who were in the midst of fighting a fire while their own homes were burning.
And on this issue it is a–it is a critical issue that is about what we must do to confront what is immediate and before us right now.
That is why I support a Green New Deal.
It is why I believe on day one and as President will re-enter us in the Paris agreement because we have to take these issues seriously and frankly, we have a President of the United States we talked about you asked before what is the greatest national security threat to the United States?
It’s Donald Trump.
And I’m going to tell you why.
And I’m going to tell you why because I agree climate change represents an existential threat.
He denies the science.
You want to talk about North Korea, real threat in terms of nuclear arsenal but what doe she do?
He embraces Kim Jong Un a dictator
Gridlock will not magically disappear as long as Mitch McConnell is there, first.
Second, second, that is why it is so important for us to when not just the presidency to have somebody that can run in all 50 states but to–but to win the Senate as well and that is why we have to propose policies that can be supported like Medicare X so that we can build a broad coalition of Americans to overcome broken Washington DC.
I agree with what Senator Gillibrand was saying and share a lot of her views.
We need to in gerrymandering in wash–and we need to end political gerrymandering in Washington.
Keep your pistols, keep your rifles, keep your shotguns but we can take the most dangerous weapons from the most dangerous people.
We have the NRA on the ropes because of the Moms because the Brady Group, because of Giffords, because of March for Our Lives.
But I’m the only candidate on this stage calling for a ban and buyback of every single assault weapon in America.
I’ve seen the plans of the other candidates here.
They would all leave 15 million assault in our communities.
They wouldn’t do a single thing to save a single life in Parkland.
I will approach this issue as a prosecutor.
I will approach it as the only person on this stage who has voted and passed background checks–but also as a parent of a generation who sends our children to school where we look at what they’re wearing so we can remember it in case we have to identify them later.
A generation who has seen thousands of black children killed in our streets and a generation who goes to the theater and we actually where the fire exits are.
We don’t have to live this way.
We must be a country who loves our children more than we love our guns.
Well, one of my first phone calls would be to call the European leaders and say we are back because I totally understand how important it is that the United States be part of the Western alliance.
Because once we–once Bush abuse that power what happened was we got elected after that.
I made sure the president turned to me and said Joe, get our combat troops out of Iraq.
I was responsible for getting 150,000 combat troops out of Iraq and my son was one of them.
I also think we should not have combat troops in Afghanistan.
It’s long overdue.
It should end.
And I thirdly I believe that you are not going to find anybody who has pulled together more of our alliances to deal with what is the real stateless threat out there.
We cannot go it alone in terms of dealing with terrorism.
So I would eliminate the–the act that allowed us to go into war and not the AU and fan make sure that it could only be used for what it’s intended–what its intent was and that is to go after terrorist but never do it alone.
That is why we have to repair our alliances.
We put together 65 countries to make sure we dealt with ISIS in Iraq and other places.
That is what I would do.
That is what I have done and I know how to do it.
Closing now?
Together we are on a mission.
We’re on a mission to find the America that’s been lost, lost through infighting, lost through inaction.
We’re so much better than this.
We’re a country that used to do things.
We saved the world.
We created the American dream for millions of people like myself, the grandson of immigrants, the son of a union electrician who went on to become a successful business leader and create thousands of jobs.
But we did these things with real solutions, not with impossible promises.
And those are the roots that we have to get back to.
I’m running for president to solve these problems, to build infrastructure, to fix our broken health care system, to invest in communities that have been left behind, to improve public education.
I just don’t want to be your president to be your president.
I want to be your president to do the job.
This is not about me.
This is about getting America working again.
It matters.
It matters in this fight for the heart and soul of our party that we nominate a candidate who has seen the face of poverty and didn’t just talk about it, but gave people $15 minimum wage.
It matters that we nominate a candidate who saw the destruction wrought by a broken health care system and gave people universal health care.
It matters that we choose someone who saw the wasted potential of our children denied pre-K and gave it to every single one of them for free.
These things really matter.
And these are the things that I’ve done in New York and I want to do the same for this whole country, because putting working people first, it matters.
We need to be that party again.
Let’s work together.
With your help, we can put working people first again in America.
(OFF-MIKE) grandchildren, we love them all.
And when I was thinking about whether to run for president, I made a decision.
I decided that on my last day on Earth, I wanted to look them in the eye and tell them I did everything humanly possible to protect them from the ravages of the climate crisis.
And I know to a moral certainty, if we do not have the next president who commits to this as the top priority, it won’t get done.
And I am the only candidate — frankly, I’m surprised.
I’m the only candidate who’s made this commitment to make it the top priority.
If you join me in that recognition of how important this is, we can have a unified national mission.
We can save ourselves.
We can save our children.
We can save our grandchildren.
And we can save literally the life on this planet.
This is our moment.
There’s nothing worse than not being heard.
Nothing worse than not being seen.
And I know that because I’ve represented for 17 years in Congress a forgotten community.
They’ve tried to divide us, who’s white, who’s black, who’s gay, who’s straight, who’s a man, who’s a woman.
And they ran away with all the gold because they divided the working class.
It’s time for us to come together.
I don’t know how you feel, but I’m ready to play some offense.
I come from the middle of industrial America, but these problems are all over our country.
There’s a tent city in L.A. There’s homeless people and people around our country who can’t afford a home.
It’s time for us to get back on track.
The teacher in Texas, the nurse in New Hampshire, the waitress in Wisconsin, all of us coming together, playing offense with an agenda that lifts everybody up.
I will only promise you one thing.
When I walk into that Oval Office every morning, you will not be forgotten.
Your voice will be heard.
Thank you.
Our nation was founded on the principles of service above self, people who fled kings, who literally prospered on the backs and the sacrifices of people, coming here to this country, instead putting in place a government that is of, by, and for the people.
But that’s not what we have.
Instead, we have a government that is of, by, and for the rich and powerful.
This must end.
As president, our White House — our White House will be a beacon of light, providing hope and opportunity, ushering in a new century where every single person will be able to get the health care they need, where we will have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink, where we will have good-paying jobs and a new green economy.
Join me in ushering in this new century with peace, prosperity, opportunity, and justice for all.
Me llamo Julian Castro, y estoy postolando por presidente de los Estados Unidos.
The very fact that I can say that tonight shows the progress that we have made in this country.
Like many of you, I know the promise of America.
My grandmother came here when she was 7 years old as an immigrant from Mexico, and just two generations later, one of her grandsons is serving in the United States Congress and the other one is running for president of the United States.
If I’m elected president, I will work hard every single day so that you and your family can get good health care, your child can get a good education, and that you can have good job opportunities, whether you live in a big city or a small town.
And on January 20, 2021, we’ll say adios to Donald Trump.
Three things to know about me.
First, I listen to people and that’s how I get things done.
That is my focus.
I have a track record of passing over 100 bills where I’m the lead Democrat.
And that is because I listened and I acted.
And I think that’s important in a president.
Everything else just melts away.
Secondly, I’m someone that can win and beat Donald trump.
I have won every place, every race, and every time.
I have won in the reddest of districts, ones that Donald Trump won by over 20 points.
I can win in states like Wisconsin and Iowa and in Michigan.
And finally, yeah, I am not the establishment party candidate.
I’ve got respect, but I’m not that person.
I am the one that doesn’t have a political machine, that doesn’t come from money.
And I don’t make all the promises that everyone up here makes.
But I can promise you this.
I am going to govern with integrity.
I’m going to (OFF-MIKE) I’m going to govern for you.
Gracias.
Fifty years ago this month, my family moved into the town I grew up in because after being denied a house because of the color of their skin, it was activists, mostly white activists, that stood up and fought for them.
That’s the best of who we are as America and why when I got out of law school, I moved into the inner city of Newark to fight as a tenant lawyer for other people’s rights.
I’ve taken on bullies and beat them.
I’ve taken on tough fights and we’ve won.
And we win those fights not by showing the worst of who we are, by rising to who’s best.
Donald Trump wants us to fight him on his turf and his terms.
We will beat him, I will beat him by calling this country to a sense of common purpose again.
This is a referendum on him and getting rid of him, but it’s also a referendum on us, who we are, and who we must be to each other.
It’s time we win this election.
And the way I’ll govern is by showing the best of who we are because that’s what this country needs and deserves.
Our daughter, Molly, turned 11 this week.
I’m on this stage for her, for children across this country, including some her same age who’ve been separated from their parents and are sleeping on concrete floors under aluminum blankets tonight.
If we’re going to be there for them, if we’re going to confront the challenges that we face, we can’t return to the same old approach.
We’re going to need a new kind of politics, one directed by the urgency of the next generation, those climate activists, who are fighting not just for their future but for everyone’s, those students marching not just for their lives but for all of ours.
We’ll need a movement like the one that we led in Texas.
It renewed our democracy by bringing everyone in and writing nobody off.
That’s how we beat Donald Trump.
That’s how we bring this great country together again.
Join us.
This is our moment.
And the generations that follow are counting on us to meet it.
Thank you.
It’s a great honor to be here.
Never in a million years did I think I would stand on a stage like this.
I was born and raised in Oklahoma.
I have three older brothers.
They all joined the military.
I had a dream growing up.
And my dream was to be a public school teacher.
By the time I graduated from high school, my family — my family didn’t have the money for a college application, much less a chance for me to go to college.
But I got my chance.
It was a $50 a semester commuter college.
That was a little slice of government that created some opportunity for a girl.
And it opened my life.
I am in this fight because I believe that we can make our government, we can make our economy, we can make our country work not just for those at the top.
We can make it work for everyone.
And I promise you this: I will fight for you as hard as I fight for my own family.
We can’t be a forward looking party if we look to the past for leadership.
I’m a congressman but also a father of a two year old and an infant.
When I’m not changing diapers, I’m changing Washington.
Most of the time the diapers smell better.
I went to congress at 31.
And I found a Washington that doesn’t work for people like you or me.
It’s made of the rich and the disconnected.
I was the first in my family to go to college and have student loan debt.
So, I have led the effort to elect the next generation of members of Congress and we have a moment to seize.
This is a can do generation.
This is a generation that will end climate chaos.
This is the generation that will solve student loan debt.
And this is the generation that will say enough is enough and end gun violence.
This generation demands bold solutions.
That’s why I’m running for president.
I’m sorry we haven’t talked more tonight about how we are going to beat Donald Trump.
I have an idea about Donald Trump.
Donald Trump is not going to be beaten just by insider politics talk.
He’s not going to be beaten just by somebody who has plans.
He is going to be beaten by somebody who has an idea what this man has done.
This man has reached into the psyche of the American people and he has harnessed fear for political purposes.
So, Mr. President, if you’re listening, I want you to hear me please–you have harnessed fear for political purposes and only love can cast that out.
So, I sir, I have a feeling you know what you’re doing.
I’m going to harness love for political purposes.
I will meet you on that field and, sir, love will win.
Thank you.
Thank you.
My mom and her parents came to the United States to rebuild their shattered lives 3–in the only country that they could, 300 years before that my parents family came searching religious freedom here.
The ability for one generation to do better than the next is now severely at risk in the United States especially among children living in poverty like the ones I used to work for in the Denver public schools.
That’s why I’m running for president.
I’ve had two tough races in Colorado by bringing people together not by making empty promises.
And I believe we need to build a broad coalition of Americans to beat Donald Trump and the corruption in Washington and build a new era of–of American democracy and American opportunity.
This is going to be hard to do, but it’s what our parents would’ve expected.
It’s what our kids deserve.
–I hope you join me in this effort.
Thank you.
I’m a small business owner who brought that same scrappy spirit to big Colorado, one of the most progressive states in America.
We’ve expanded reproductive health to–to reduce teenage abortion by 64 percent.
We were the first state to legalize marijuana and we transformed our justice system in the process.
We passed universal background checks in a purple state.
We got to near universal healthcare coverage.
We attack climate change with the toughest methane regulations in the country.
And for the last three years, we’ve been the number one economy in America.
You don’t need big government to do big things.
I know that because I’m the one person up here who’s actually done the big progressive things everyone else is talking about.
If we turn towards socialism, we run the risk of helping to reelect the worst president in American history.
Women in America–women in America are on fire.
We’ve marched, we’ve organized, we’ve run for office and we’ve won.
But, our rights are under attack like never before by President Trump and the Republicans who want to repeal Roe v.
Wade, which is why I went to the front lines in Georgia to fight for them.
As president, I will take on the fights that no one else will.
I stood up to the Pentagon and repealed Don’t Ask Don’t Tell.
I’ve stood up to the banks and voted against the bail out twice.
I’ve stood up to Trump more than any other senator in the U.S. Senate.
And I have the most comprehensive approach for getting money out of politics with publicly funded elections to deal with political corruption.
Now is not the time to play it safe.
Now is not the time to be afraid of first.
We need a president who will take on the big challenges even if she stands alone.
Join me in fighting for this.
First, I want to thank everyone who put me on this stage tonight.
I am proof that our democracy still works.
Democrats and Americans around the country have one question for their nominee and that is who can beat Donald Trump in 2020.
That is the right question.
And the right candidate to beat Donald Trump will be solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected and will have a vision of a trickle up economy that is already drawing thousands of disaffected Trump voters, conservatives, independents, and libertarians, as well as Democrats and progressives.
I am that candidate.
I can build a much broader coalition to beat Donald Trump.
It is not left.
It is not right.
It is forward and that is where I’ll take the country in 2020.
Thank you.
Well, I–I just want to leave you with a couple of things.
One, we need a nominee who has the ability to prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump and I will do that.
Second, this election is about you.
This is about your hopes and your dreams and your fears and what wakes you up at 3:00 in the morning.
And that’s why I have what I call a 3:00 a.m. agenda that is about everything from what we need to do to deliver healthcare to how you will be able to pay the bills by the end of the month.
And when I think about what our country needs, I promise you I will be a president who leads with a sense of dignity, with honest, speaking the truth, and giving the American family all that they need to get through the end of the month in a way that allows them to prosper.
So, I hope to own–earn your support.
Please join us at kamalaharris.org.
Nothing about politics is theoretical for me.
I’ve had the experience of writing a letter to my family, putting it in an envelope marked just in case and leaving it where they would know where to find it in case I didn’t come back from Afghanistan.
I have the experience of being in a marriage that exists by the grace of a single vote on the U.S. Supreme Court and I have the experience of guiding a community where the per capita income was below $20,000 when I took office into a brighter future.
I am running because the decisions we make in the next three or four years are going to decide how the next 30 or 40 go and when I get to the current age of the current President in the year 2055 I want to be able to look back on these years and save my generation delivered climate solutions, racial equality and an end to endless war.
Help me deliver that new generation to Washington before it’s too late.
I suspect people all over the country who are watching this debate are saying these are good people, they have great ideas but how come nothing really changes?
How come for the last 45 years wages have been stagnant for the middle class?
How come we have the highest rate of childhood poverty?
How come 45 million people still have student debt West Denmark how can three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America?
And here is the answer, nothing will change unless we have the guts to take on Wall Street, the insurance industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the military industrial complex in the fossil fuel industry.
If we don’t have the guts to take them on we will continue to have plans, we will continue to have talk and rich will get richer and everybody else will be struggling.
Thank you very much.
I am running to leave this country because I think it is important we restore the soul of this nation.
This President has ripped it out.
He is the only President in our history who has equated racist and–and white supremacist with ordinary decent people.
He is the only President who is that in engaged and embraced dictators and thumb their nose at our allies.
I am secondly running for President because I think we have to restore the backbone of America.
The poor and hard-working middle-class people.
You can’t do that without replacing them with the dignity they once had.
Lastly, we’ve got to unite the United States of America as much as anybody says we can’t.
If we do, there’s not a single thing the American people can’t do.
This is the United States of America.
We can do anything if we’re together, together.
So, God bless you all and may God protect our troops.
And that doesn’t count the money that was paid to executives, the money that was spent lobbying Washington.
We have a giant industry that wants our health care system to stay the way it is, because it’s not working for families, but it’s sure as heck working for them.
