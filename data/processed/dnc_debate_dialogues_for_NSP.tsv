Economy	All right.
Economy	So with that business out of the way, we want to get to it.
Economy	And we’ll start this evening with Senator Elizabeth Warren., Senator, good evening to you.
Economy	Thank you.
Economy	Good to be here.
	
Guns	OK, thank you, Senator Warren.
Guns	You didn’t address — do you think the federal government needs to go and figure out a way to get the guns that are already out there?
Guns	What I think we need to do is we need to treat it like a serious research problem, which we have not done.
Guns	You know, guns in the hands of a collector who’s had them for decades, who’s never fired them, who takes safety seriously, that’s very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly.
Guns	We can’t treat this as an across-the-board problem.
Guns	We have to treat it like a public health emergency.
Guns	That means bring data to bear and it means make real change in this country, whether it’s politically popular or not.
Guns	Thank you, Senator.
Guns	Senator Booker, you have a program…
Guns	We need to fight for our children.
Guns	Senator Booker, you have a federal government buyback program in your plan.
Guns	How is that going to work?
Guns	Well, first of all, I want to say, my colleague and I both have been hearing this on the campaign trail.
Guns	But what’s even worse is I hear gunshots in my neighborhood.
Guns	I think I’m the only one — I hope I’m the only one on this panel here that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week.
Guns	Someone I knew, Shahad Smith, was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year.
Guns	For millions of Americans, this is not a policy issue.
Guns	This is an urgency.
Guns	And for those that have not been directly affected, they’re tired of living in country where their kids go to school to learn about reading, writing, and arithmetic, and how to deal with an active shooter in their school.
Guns	This is something that I’m tired of.
Guns	And I’m tired of hearing people all, they have to offer is thoughts and prayers.
Guns	In my faith, people say faith without works is dead.
Guns	So we will find a way.
Guns	But the reason we have a problem right now is we’ve let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate.
Guns	It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda.
Guns	I will get that done as president of the United States because this is not about policy.
Guns	This is personal.
Guns	Thank you, Senator Booker.
Guns	Secretary Castro, I’d like to talk to you about something that Senator Booker just mentioned there, the idea of active shooter drills in schools, as school shootings seem like an almost everyday or every week occurrence now.
Guns	They don’t make a complete news cycle anymore, no matter the death toll.
Guns	As parents are so afraid as their kids go off to school that their kids will be caught up in something like this, next to nothing has changed in federal law that might affect the prevalence of school shootings.
Guns	Is this a problem that is going to continue to get worse over our lifetimes?
Guns	Or is there something that you would do as president that you really think would turn it around?
Guns	You know, Rachel, I am the dad of a 10-year-old girl, Carina, who’s here tonight.
Guns	And the worst thing is knowing that your child might be worried about what could happen at school, a place that’s supposed to be safe.
Guns	The answer to your question is no.
Guns	We don’t have to accept that.
Guns	And I believe that, on January 20, 2021, at 12:01 p.m., we’re going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House, and a Democratic Senate.
Guns	And the activists of Parkland, folks from Moms Demand who have risen up across the United States and inspired so many people… … you know, we may not have seen yet legislative action, but we’re getting closer.
Guns	The House took a vote.
Guns	In the Senate, the question often is, if the decision is between 60 votes, a filibuster, or passing commonsense gun reform, I’m going to choose commonsense gun reform.
Guns	So I believe that we’re going to be able to get that done in 2021.
Guns	Secretary Castro, thank you.
Guns	Rachel, I have something to add to this briefly, because…
Guns	We’ll give you — it’ll be 30 seconds for a follow-up on that question — on that answer from Secretary Castro.
Guns	Congressman Ryan?
Guns	You’re talking about in the schools.
Guns	These kids are traumatized.
Guns	I support all the gun reforms here.
Guns	We need to start dealing with the trauma that our kids have.
Guns	We need trauma-based care in every school.
Guns	We need social and emotional learning in every school.
Guns	Ninety percent of the shooters who do school shootings come from the school they’re in, and 73 percent of them feel shamed, traumatized, or bullied.
Guns	We need to make sure that these kids feel connected to the school.
Guns	That means a mental health counselor in every single school in the United States.
Guns	We need to start playing offense.
Guns	If our kids are so traumatized that they’re getting a gun and going into our schools, we’re doing something wrong, too, and we need reform around trauma-based care.
Guns	Thank you, Congressman Ryan.
Guns	Congressman O’Rourke, you’re a Texan who’s campaigned — you campaigned all over the state in 2018 in the most conservative parts there.
Guns	What do you tell a gun owner who may agree with you on everything else, OK, but says, you know what, the Democrats, if I vote for them in there, they’re going to take my gun away, and even though I agree with you on all these other issues — how do you have that conversation?
Guns	Here’s how we have that conversation in Texas.
Guns	I shared with them what I learned from those students who survived the Santa Fe high school shooting, a young student named Bree.
Guns	Her friend, Marcel, who survived another shooting, the mother of a victim who lost her life, Rhonda Hart, they talked about universal background checks, where you close every loophole.
Guns	We know that they save lives.
Guns	We talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities.
Guns	Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible.
Guns	They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities.
Guns	Red flag laws, so if someone poses a danger to themselves or to someone else, they’re stopped before it’s too late.
Guns	And what I found in each one of those 254 counties is that Democrats and independents and Republicans, gun-owners and non-gun-owners alike, agreed.
Guns	But this effort must be led by the young people that you referenced at the beginning of this issue.
Guns	Those students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas led the charge here in Florida, and they’ve been able to change those laws.
Guns	They’re making our democracy work, ensuring that our values and our interests and our priorities are reflected in the laws that we pass.
Guns	Thank you, Congressman O’Rourke.
Guns	Hang on.
Guns	Let me give 30 seconds, Senator Klobuchar, the iron range.
Guns	I’m curious.
Guns	Gun confiscation, right?
Guns	If the government is buying back, how do you not have that conversation?
Guns	Well, that’s not confiscation.
Guns	You could give them the offer to buy back their gun.
Guns	But I’ll say this.
Guns	I look at these proposals and I say, does this hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand, coming from a proud hunting and fishing state?
Guns	These proposals don’t do that.
Guns	When I was a prosecutor, I supported the assault weapons ban.
Guns	When I was in the Senate, I saw those moms from Sandy Hook come and try to advocate for change, and we all failed.
Guns	And then now these Parkland kids from Florida, they started literally a national shift.
Guns	You know why?
Guns	It’s just like with gay marriage.
Guns	When kids talked to their parents and their grandparents, they say I don’t understand why we can’t put these sensible things in place, they listen.
Guns	And if we get bested by a bunch of 17-year-olds…
Guns	All right, Senator, thank you.
Guns	… it’s the best thing that ever happened.
Guns	We need to get…
Guns	Senator, thank you.
Guns	Senator, thank you.
Guns	Senator Booker, let me go to you on another matter actually.
Guns	We’ve got to…
	
Mitch McConnell	I’m going to get to — I’m going to get a couple of you in here.
Mitch McConnell	I’m going to get a couple of you in here.
Mitch McConnell	Thirty seconds, Congressman Delaney, you seem to believe you can do everything in a bipartisan manner.
Mitch McConnell	Mitch McConnell doesn’t operate that way.
Mitch McConnell	He operates differently.
Mitch McConnell	Why do you think he is going to conform to your style?
Mitch McConnell	I think we need to get things done.
Mitch McConnell	That’s why I believe we need to operate in a bipartisan manner.
Mitch McConnell	Listen, I will sign into law bills that come to the White House that are passed on a party-line basis, absolutely.
Mitch McConnell	But all the big transformative things we’ve ever done in this country’s history have happened when huge majorities of the American people get behind them, which is why we need real solutions, not impossible promises.
Mitch McConnell	We need to put forth ideas that work, whether it’s on health care, creating universal health care so that every American gets health care, but not running on making private insurance illegal.
Mitch McConnell	The gun issue is related.
Mitch McConnell	The gun safety issue is related, because I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been with folks in Western Maryland, and they’ve said to me, you know, Democrats don’t do anything for us, Republicans don’t do anything for us.
Mitch McConnell	You fight all the time, so they vote on that single issue.
Mitch McConnell	OK.
Mitch McConnell	If we become the party of getting things done for the American people, with real solutions and not impossible promises, we’ll be able to get all these things done.
Mitch McConnell	I promised…
Mitch McConnell	Senator Booker, 30 seconds.
Mitch McConnell	You — how do you deal with Mitch?
Mitch McConnell	You’ve been in the Senate.
Mitch McConnell	You can’t get bills on the floor right now with Mitch McConnell.
Mitch McConnell	Presidents can’t do it.
Mitch McConnell	Is President Booker going to get his bills on the floor with Senator McConnell?
Mitch McConnell	You know, when I got to the United States Senate, going back to what De Blasio said, as an African-American man in an African-American-dominated community, I knew one of the biggest issue was criminal justice reform, from police accountability to dealing with the fact that we have a nation that has more African-Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850.
Mitch McConnell	And when I got to the Senate, people told me we could not get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done.
Mitch McConnell	As my colleagues in the Senate know, I fought on that bill from the day I got to the Senate, built coalitions across the aisle, and today we passed the First Step Act.
Mitch McConnell	It’s not as far as I want to go, but thousands of people will be liberated.
Mitch McConnell	I have gotten — I have taken on tough problems people said we cannot achieve, and I’ve been able to get things accomplished.
Mitch McConnell	Thank you, Senator Booker.
Mitch McConnell	Rachel has got the next question.
	
Climate Change	Governor Inslee, thank you.
Climate Change	Congressman O’Rourke, you also put out a big climate change plan from your campaign.
Climate Change	You want some big changes in a pretty short period of time, including switching to renewable energy, pushing to replace gas-powered cars in favor of electric ones.
Climate Change	What’s your message to a voter who supports the overall goal of what you’re trying to do, but suddenly feels as if government’s telling them how to live and ordering them how to live?
Climate Change	What is that balance like?
Climate Change	I think you’ve got to bring everybody in to the decisions and the solutions to the challenges that we face.
Climate Change	That’s why we’re traveling everywhere, listening to everyone.
Climate Change	We were in Pacific Junction, a town that had never meaningly flooded before, just up against the Missouri River in Iowa.
Climate Change	And every home in that community had flooded.
Climate Change	There were farms just outside of Pacific Junction that were effectively lakes, those farmers already underwater in debt, their markets closed to them by a trade war under this administration, and now they don’t know what to do.
Climate Change	We in our administration are going fund resiliency in those communities, in Miami, in Houston, Texas, those places that are on the front lines of climate change today.
Climate Change	We’re going to mobilize $5 trillion in this economy over the next 10 years.
Climate Change	We’re going to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels, and we’re going to put farmers and ranchers in the driver’s seat, renewable and sustainable agriculture, to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil, paying farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide.
Climate Change	If all of us does all that we can, then we’re going to be able to keep this planet from warming another 2 degrees Celsius, and ensure that we match what this country can do and live up to our promise and our potential.
Climate Change	Thirty seconds, Secretary Castro, does — who pays for the mitigation to — to climate, whether it’s building sea walls, for people that are perhaps living in places that they shouldn’t be living?
Climate Change	Is this a federal government issue that needs to do that?
Climate Change	Do they have to move these people?
Climate Change	What do you do about that, where maybe they’re building a place someplace that isn’t safe?
Climate Change	Who pays to build that house?
Climate Change	And how much should the government be bailing them out?
Climate Change	Well, I don’t think that that represents the vast majority of the issue.
Climate Change	In fact, you know, my first visit after I announced my candidacy wasn’t to Iowa or New Hampshire.
Climate Change	It was to San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Climate Change	Because people should know that if I’m elected president, everybody will count.
Climate Change	And, you know, I’m one of the few candidates in this race with executive experience, with a track record of getting things done.
Climate Change	When I was mayor of San Antonio, we moved our local public utility, we began to shift it from coal-fired plants to solar and other renewables, and also created more than 800 jobs doing that.
Climate Change	And when I was HUD secretary, we worked on the National Disaster Resilience Competition to invest in communities that were trying to rebuild from natural disasters in a sustainable way.
Climate Change	That’s the way that we’re going to help make sure that we’re all safer in the years to come and that we combat climate change.
Climate Change	Thank you.
Climate Change	And if I’m elected president, the first thing that I would do, like Senator Klobuchar also has said, is sign an executive order recommitting us to the Paris Climate Accord so that we lead again…
Climate Change	All right.
Climate Change	Congressman Ryan, I got a full question for you here, which is simply this.
Climate Change	There are — a lot of the climate plans include pricing carbon, taxing carbon in some way.
Climate Change	This type of proposal has been tried in a few places, whether it’s Washington state where voters voted it down, you’ve had the Yellow Vest Movement, we had in Australia one party get rejected out of fear of the cost of climate change sort of being put on the backs of the consumer.
Climate Change	If pricing carbon is just politically impossible, how do we pay for climate mitigation?
Climate Change	Well, there is a variety of different ways to pay.
Climate Change	We talked about different ways of raising revenue.
Climate Change	And I think we’ve got to build our way out of this and grow our way out of this.
Climate Change	But let me just talk real quick to the previous question about real politics.
Climate Change	We could talk about climate, we could talk about guns, we could talk about all of these issues that we all care about.
Climate Change	We have a perception problem with the Democratic Party.
Climate Change	We are not connecting to the working class people in the very states that I represent in Ohio, in the industrial Midwest.
Climate Change	We’ve lost all connection.
Climate Change	We have got to change the center of gravity of the Democratic Party from being coastal and elital — elitist and Ivy League, which is the perception, to somebody from the forgotten communities that have been left behind for the last 30 years, to get those workers back on our side so we can say we’re going to build electric vehicles, we’re going to build solar panels.
Climate Change	But if you want to beat Mitch McConnell, this better be a working-class party.
Climate Change	If you want to go into Kentucky and take his rear end out, and if you want to take Lindsey Graham out, you’ve got to have a blue collar party that can go into the textile communities in South Carolina.
Climate Change	So all I’m saying here…
Climate Change	Thank you, Congressman Ryan.
Climate Change	All I’m saying here…
Climate Change	Thank you, Congressman Ryan.
Climate Change	So, Chuck, Chuck…
Climate Change	All I’m saying is here, if we don’t address that fundamental problem with our connection to workers — white, black, brown, gay, straight — working-class people…
Climate Change	Thank you, Congressman.
Climate Change	… none of this is going to get done, Chuck.
Climate Change	Thank you very much.
Climate Change	Chuck…
Climate Change	I want to you — we’re going to keep moving.
Climate Change	Congressman Delaney, I’m going to get to you…
Climate Change	This is — I introduced the only bipartisan carbon tax bill…
Climate Change	Thirty seconds — all right, 30 seconds, go.
Climate Change	This is really important.
Climate Change	All the economists agree that a carbon pricing mechanism works.
Climate Change	You just have to do it right.
Climate Change	You can’t put a price on carbon, raise energy prices, and not give the money back to the American people.
Climate Change	My proposal, which is put a price on carbon, give a dividend back to the American people.
Climate Change	It goes out one pocket, back in the other.
Climate Change	Thank you, Congressman.
Climate Change	I can get that passed my first year as president with a coalition of every Democrat in the Congress and the Republicans who live in coastal states.
Climate Change	Thank you.
Climate Change	Congressman, thank you.
Climate Change	Because Republicans in Florida, they actually care about this issue.
Climate Change	OK.
Climate Change	Thank you very much.
Climate Change	This has got to be our way forward if we’re actually serious about this issue.
	
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	I want to go down the line here, finish up foreign policy.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	It’s a simple question.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	What is our — what is the biggest threat — what is — who is the geopolitical threat to the United States?
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Just give me a one-word answer, Congressman Delaney.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Could you repeat the question?
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Greatest geopolitical threat to the United States right now.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Congressman Delaney?
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Well, the biggest geopolitical challenge is China.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	But the biggest geopolitical threat remains nuclear weapons.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	OK.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Right, so those are — you know, those are different questions.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	I got you.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Totally get it.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Go ahead.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Governor Inslee?
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	The biggest threat to the security of the United States is Donald Trump.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	And there’s no question about it.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Congresswoman Gabbard?
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	The greatest…
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Greatest geopolitical threat.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	The greatest threat that we face is the fact that we’re in a greater risk of nuclear war today than ever before in history.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Senator Klobuchar?
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Two threats, economic threat, China, but our major threat right now is what’s going in the Mideast with Iran, if we don’t get…
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	OK, try to keep it at one — slimmer than what we’ve been going here.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	One or two words.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Our existential threat is climate change.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	We have to confront it before it’s too late.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Senator Warren?
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Climate change.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Yeah.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Senator Booker?
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Nuclear proliferation and climate change.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Secretary Castro?
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	China and climate change.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Congressman Ryan?
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	China, without a question.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	They’re wiping us around the world economically.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	And Mr. Mayor?
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	BLASIO: Russia, because they’re trying to undermine our democracy and they’ve been doing a pretty damn good job of it, and we need to stop them.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	All right.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Well, thank you for that wide variety of answers, and I mean that.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	No, I mean that in — that’s what this debate is about.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	This is the best part of a debate like this.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Congressman O’Rourke, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report outlines multiple instances of potential criminal behavior by President Trump.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	House Speaker Pelosi has publicly and privately resisted any move toward impeachment in the House.
Biggest Geopolitical Threat	If the House chooses not to impeach, as president, would you do anything to address the potential crimes that were outlined in Mr. Mueller’s report?
	
Impeachment	Thank you, Congressman O’Rourke.
Impeachment	Congressman Delaney, because of the accountability issues that Congressman O’Rourke was just describing there and the real political landscape in which Nancy Pelosi is saying that impeachment will not be pursued in the House, it raises the prospect — and the Mueller Report raises the prospect that President Trump could be prosecuted for some of those potential crimes down the line.
Impeachment	No U.S. president has ever been prosecuted for crimes after leaving office.
Impeachment	Do you believe that President Trump could or should be the first?
Impeachment	I guess there’s always a first.
Impeachment	Should he be?
Impeachment	I don’t think anyone is above the law.
Impeachment	I don’t think anyone is above the law, including a president.
Impeachment	I support Speaker Pelosi’s decisions that she is making in the House of Representatives right now as speaker.
Impeachment	I think she knows more about the decision as to whether to impeach the president than any of the 2020 candidates combined.
Impeachment	Conceded.
Impeachment	On the issue of prosecution…
Impeachment	So — but I do think — I do think the — no one is above the law, and this president, who is lawless, should not be above the law.
Impeachment	But I will tell you, Rachel, the one thing when you’re out doing as much campaigning as I’ve done, 400 events, all 99 counties in Iowa, this is not the number-one issue the American people ask us about.
Impeachment	It’s not.
Impeachment	They want to know what we’re going to do for health care, how we’re going to lower pharmaceutical prices, how we’re going to build infrastructure, what we’re going to do to create jobs in their communities.
Impeachment	You know, last year in our country, 80 percent of the money for start-up businesses went to 50 counties in this country.
Impeachment	There’s over 3,000 counties in this country.
Impeachment	That’s what they care about.
Impeachment	They care about what’s going on in the public schools.
Impeachment	They care about what’s going on with jobs in their communities, with their pay, with their health care, with infrastructure.
Impeachment	These are the issues, these kind of kitchen-table, pocket-book issues…
Impeachment	Understood.
Impeachment	… are actually what most Americans care about.
Impeachment	They never ask about the Mueller Report.
Impeachment	Congressman, thank you.
Impeachment	Your time is up.
Impeachment	They never ask about it.
Impeachment	They want to know how we’re going to solve these problems.
Impeachment	Your time’s…
Impeachment	Here’s the thing.
Impeachment	I still — Senator…
Impeachment	… but if we let the Republicans run our elections and if do not do something about Russian interference in the election and we let Mitch McConnell stop all the backup paper ballots, then we’re not going to get what we want to do.
Impeachment	I’ve got to sneak in — we blew through a break, which was good news, to give you more time, so I got to sneak one in now.
Impeachment	More of this debate.
Impeachment	It’s picking up here.
Impeachment	It continues right after this.
	
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	BALART: Before we do I want to say hello and good evening, Buenos noches to Mayor Buttigieg.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	BALART: (UNTRANSLATED) Many of your colleagues on stage support free college.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	You do not.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	Why not?
	
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Senator, your time is up.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I want to put that same question to Mayor Buttigieg.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Yeah, we’ve taught look, everybody who says Medicare for All, every person in politics who allows that phrase to escape their lips has a responsibility to explain how you’re actually supposed to get from here to there.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Now here’s how I would do it.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	It’s very similar.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I would call it Medicare for All Who Want It. you take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, and you make it available on the exchanges it.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	People can buy in.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	and then if people like us are right that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single payer environment.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	But, let’s remember even in countries that have outright socialized medicine, like England, even there there’s still a private sector, that’s fine.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	It’s just that for our primary care we can’t be relying on the tender verses of the corporate system.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	This one is very personal for me.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I started out this year dealing with a terminal illness of my father.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I make decisions for a living and nothing could have prepared me for the kind of decisions our family faced.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	But, the thing we had going for us was that we never had to make those decisions based on whether it was gonna bankrupt our family because of Medicare.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And I want every–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Time.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And I want every family to have that same freedom to do what is medically right, not (INAUDIBLE).
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Your time is complete.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Vice President Biden, I want to put the question to you.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	You were an ar–one of the architects of Obama Care.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	So, where do we go from here?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Look, this is a very personal to me.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	When my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident my two boys were really very badly injured.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I couldn’t imagine what it’d be like had I not had adequate healthcare available immediately.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And then when my son came home from Iraq after a year he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and he was given months to live.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I can’t fathom what would have happened if, in fact, they said by the way the last six months of your life you’re on your own.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We’re cutting off.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	You’ve used up your time.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	The fact of the matter is that the quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obama Care, to build on what we did.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And secondly, secondly, to make sure that everyone does have an option.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Everyone, whether they have private insurance, employer insurance or no insurance, they, in fact, can buy into the exchange to a Medicare like plan.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And the way you do that, you can do it quicker look, urgency matters.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	There’s people right now facing what I’ve faced and what we’ve faced without any of the help I had.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We must move now.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I’m against any democrat who opposes–in fact–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Vice President Biden, your time is–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Takes down Obama Care and any republican who wants to get rid of it.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Let me–let me turn to Senator Sanders.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Senator Sanders, you have basically–you basically want to scrap the private health insurance system as we know it and replace it with a government run plan.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	None of the states that have tried something like that, California, Vermont, New York has struggled with it, have been successful.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	If politicians can’t make it work in those states how would you implement it on a national level.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	How does this work?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Lester, I find it hard to believe that every other major country on earth, including my neighbor 50 miles north of me, Canada, somehow has figured out a way to provide healthcare to every man, woman and child, and in most cases they’re spending 50 percent per capita of what we are spending.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Let’s be clear, let us be very clear the function of healthcare today from the insurance and drug company perspective is not to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	The function of the healthcare system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And, last year, if you could believe it, while we paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and I will lower prescription drug prices in half in this country, top ten companies made $69 billion in profit.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	They will spend 100’s of millions of dollars lying to the American people telling us why we cannot have a–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Senator–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Medicare for All.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I just have to follow up there, how do you implement it on a national level.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I’m sorry?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	How do you implement it on a national level given the fact that it’s not succeeded in other states that have tried?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I will tell you how we’ll do it.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We’ll do it the way real change has always taken place, whether it was the labor movement, the civil rights movement or the women’s movement.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We will have Medicare for all when tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up and tell the insurance companies and the drug companies that their day is gone, that healthcare is a human right, not something to make huge profits off of.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	All right.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Ms. Williamson–Ms. Williamson this is a question for you.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Excuse me, excuse me.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I am addressing the question to Ms. Williamson.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We have been talking a lot about access to health insurance but for many Americans their most pressing concern is the high cost of healthcare.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	How would you lower the cost of prescription drugs?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Well, first of all the government should never have made the deal with the big farm at that they couldn’t negotiate; that was just part of the regular corruption by which multinational corporations have their way with us.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	You know I wanted to say that while I agree with–I–I’m with Senator Bennet and others but I agree with almost everything here I will tell you one thing it’s really nice if we got all these plans but if you think we are going to beat Donald Trump by just having all of these plans you’ve got another thing coming because he didn’t when by saying he had a plan.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	He won by simply saying make America great again.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We’ve got to get deeper than just the superficial fixes as important as they are.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Even if we are just talking about the superficial fixes ladies and gentlemen we don’t have a health care system in the United States, we have a sickness care system in the United States.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We just wait until somebody gets sick and then we talk about who’s going to pay for the treatment and how they are going to be treated.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	What we need to talk about is why so many Americans have unnecessary chronic illnesses so many more compared to other countries and that gets back into not just the big Pharma, not just health insurance companies, it has to do with chemical policies, it has to do with environmental policies–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	All right, Ms. Williamson your time–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–it has to do with food policies– It has to do with drug policies.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Thank you.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	It even has to do with environmental policies.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Thank you.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Senator–Senator Bennet, a question for you do you want to keep a system that we have in place with Obamacare and build on it?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	You mentioned that a moment ago.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Is that enough to get us to universal coverage?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I believe that will get us the quickest way there and I bought the vice president was very moving about this and Mayor Pete as well.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I had prostate cancer recently as you may know and that is why I was a little late getting in the race these same week my kid had her appendectomy out and I feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I think that is what the American people want.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I believe it will get us there quickly.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	There are millions of people in America that do not have health insurance today because they can’t–they are too wealthy.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Wealthy?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	They make too much money to be on Medicaid, they can’t afford health insurance.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	When Senator Sanders says that Canada is single payer, there are 35 million people in Canada.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	There are 330 million people in the United States easily the number of people on a public option.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	It could easily be 35 million and for them it would be Medicare for all as mayor Buttigieg says but for others that want to keep it they should be able to keep it.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And I think that will be the fastest way to get where we need to go.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Also I will say Bernie is a very honest person.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	He has said over and over again unlike others that have supported this legislation over and over again that this will band making it illegal all insurance except cosmetic, except insurance for I guess that’s where plastic surgery.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Everything else is banned under the Medicare for all proposal–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I–I let–I let you go a little long there but I want–but obviously Senator Sanders you have got a response.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I would like to add a point here.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Senator Sanders (INAUDIBLE).
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Just very briefly you know Mike, Medicare is the most popular–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I agree.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	— Health insurance program in the country.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	People don’t like their private insurance companies, they like their doctors and hospitals.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Under our plan people go to any doctor they want, any hospital they want.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We will substantially lower the cost of healthcare in this country because we will stop the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	On this issue–on this issue we have to think about how this affects real people–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	(INAUDIBLE) lifetime, (INAUDIBLE) for all and today–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	The reality of how this affects real people is captured in a story that many of us heard and I will para–paraphrase there is in the unite–America a parent who is seeing that their child has a temperature that is out of control, calls 911 what should I do and they say take the child to the emergency room and so they get in their car and they drive and there sitting in the parking lot outside of the emergency room looking at those sliding glass doors while they have the hand on the four head of their child knowing that if they walk through those sliding glass doors even though they have insurance they will be out 5000 deductible–$5000 deductible when they walk through those doors.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Senator, Senator–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	That is what insurance companies are doing in America today.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We’re going to continue this discussion–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–I’m one of those parents–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I wanted to put it in–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Candidates, please.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I’m one of those parents.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I was just in the emergency room with my eight month old–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Candidates, please–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–I’m one of those parents.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I was just in the emergency room.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And I’m telling you–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Congressman, thank you–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–We fight health insurance companies every single week.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Thank you.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We stand in line and pay expensive prescription drugs.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We have to have a healthcare guarantee.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	If you’re sick, you’re seen it.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And in America, you never go broke because of it.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Okay.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	With all due respect–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–A lot of you have been talking tonight about these government healthcare plans that you proposed in one form or another.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	This is a show of hands question.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And hold them up for a moment so people can see.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Raise your hand if–if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Okay.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Let me start with you, Mayor Buttigieg.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Why?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Mayor Buttigieg, why?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Because our country is healthier when everybody is healthier.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And remember, we’re talking about something people are getting a–given a chance to buy into.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	In the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes directly or indirectly.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	This is not about a handout.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	This is an insurance program.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And we do ourselves no favor by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access healthcare.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	But of course, the real problem is we shouldn’t have 11 million undocumented people with no pathway to citizenship.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	It makes no sense.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And the American people– The American people agree on what to do.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	This is the crazy thing.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	If leadership consists of–of forming a consensus around a divisive issue, this White House has divided us around a consensus issue.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	The American people want a pathway to citizenship.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	They wanted protections for Dreamers.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We need to clean up the lawful immigration system, like how my father immigrated to this country.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And as part of a compromise, we can do whatever commonsense measures are needed at the border.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Mayor–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–But Washington can’t deliver on something the American people want.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	What does that tell you about the system we’re living in?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	It tells you it needs profound–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Mayor, thank you–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Structural reform.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Vice President Biden, I believe you said that your– Health care plan would not cover undocumented immigrants.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Could you explain your position?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I’m sorry.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I beg your pardon.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I didn’t hear.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I believe at the show of hands you did not raise her hand.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Did you raise your hand?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Oh, no, I did.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I–but
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Okay.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Sorry.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Sorry.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I–so, you said that they would be covered under your plan–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Yes–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Which is different than Obama Care.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Yes.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	But here–here’s the thing.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Can you explain that change?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Yes.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	You cannot let–as the mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	You can’t do that.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	It’s just going to be taking care of, period.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	You have to.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	It’s the humane thing to do.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	But here’s the deal.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	The deal is that he’s right about three things.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Number one, they in fact contribute to the well-being of the country, but they also–for example, they’ve increased the lifespan of Social Security because they’re–they have a job.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	They’re paying the Social Security tax.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	That’s what they’re doing.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	It’s increase the lifespan.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of healthcare by them being able to be treated and not wait until there in extremis.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	The other thing is, folks, look, we can deal with these insurance companies.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We can deal with insurance companies by, number one, putting insurance executives in jail for their misleading–their misleading advertising, what they’re doing on opioids– –What they’re doing paying doctors to prescribe.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We should–we could be doing this by making sure everyone who is on Medicare–that the government should be able to negotiate the price for what–whatever the drug costs are.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We can do this by making sure that we’re in a position that we in fact allow people–you mean time’s up?
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I just want to address–
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Your time’s up.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Vice President Biden, thank you.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Actually, you can hold off a minute.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We need to take a short break here.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We got a lot more we need to talk to all of you about, so stick with us.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We’re just getting started.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We’ll be back with more from Miami right after this.
	
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	BALART: Hickenlooper day one if you are–day one at the White House how do you respond?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	With these–with these children?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	BALART: Let me get to you in–in–in just a second.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I’m sorry.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	BALART: Governor, day one, thousands of men, women and children cross the border asking for asylum for a better life.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	What do you do?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	One, day one, hour one?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Certainly the images we’ve seen this week just compound the emotional impact that the world is judging us by.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	If you had ever told me any time in my life that this country would sanction federal agents to take children from the arms of their parents, put them in cages, actually put them up for adoption–in Colorado we call that kidnapping.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I–I would have called you– I would have told you it was unbelievable.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And the first thing we have to do is recognize the humanitarian crisis on the border for what it is and make sure there are the sufficient facil-facilities in place so that women and children are not separated from their families.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	The children are with their families.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We have to make sure that–that ICE is completely reformed.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And they begin looking at their job in a humanitarian way where they are addressing the whole needs of the people that they are engaged with along the border.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And we have to make sure, ultimately, that we provide not just shelter, but food, clothing and access to medical care.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	BALART: Ms. Williamson.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Yes, what Donald Trump has done to these children and it’s not just in Colorado, Governor, you’re right–it is kidnapping.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And it’s extremely important for us to realize that.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	If you forcibly take a child from their parents arms you are kidnapping them.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And if you take a lot of children and you put them in a detainment center thus inflicting chronic trauma upon them that’s called child abuse.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	This is collective child abuse.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	This is collective child abuse.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And when this is crime–both of those things are a crime and if your government does it that doesn’t make it less of a crime.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	These are state-sponsored crimes.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And what President–and what President Trump has done is not only attack these children, not only demonize these immigrants, he is attacking a basic principle of America’s moral core.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We open our hearts to the stranger.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	This is extremely important and it’s also important for all of us remember and I have great respect for everyone who is on this–on this–on this stage but we are going to talk about what to do about healthcare.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Well, where have you been guys?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Because if it’s not just the matter of a plan and I haven’t heard anybody on this stage who has talked about American foreign policy in Latin America and how we might have in the last few decades contributed to something being more helpful(SP).
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Senator Gillibrand what would you do as President with a reality?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Well, one of the worst things about President Trump that he has done to this country is he has torn apart the moral fabric of who we are.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	When he started separating children at the border from their parents the fact that seven children have died in his custody, the fact that dozens of children have been separated from their parents and they have no plan to reunite them so I would do a few things.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	First, I would fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Second, I would reform how we treat asylum-seekers at the border.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I would have a community-based treatment center where you are doing it within the communities where asylum-seekers are given lawyers, where there is real immigration judges, not employees of the Atty.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Gen.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	but appointed for life and have a community-based system.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I would fund borders security but the worst thing President Trump has done is he has diverted the funds away from cross-border terrorism, cross-border human trafficking, drug trafficking and gun trafficking and he is given that money to the for-profit prisons.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I would not be spending money in for profit prisons–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We had–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–to lock up children and asylum-seekers.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We had a very spirited debate on this stage last night on the topic of decriminalization of the border.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	If–if you would be so kind raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross the border without documentation?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Can we keep the hands up so we can see them?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Let’s remember that’s not just a theoretical exercise, that criminalization that is the basis for family separation.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	You do away with that it is no longer possible.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Of course it wouldn’t be possible anyway in my presidency because it is dead wrong.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We have got to talk about one other thing because the Republican Party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Now our party doesn’t talk about that as much largely for a very good reason which was we are committed to the separation of church and state and we stand for people of any religion and people of no religion.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	But we should call out hypocrisy when we see it in for a party that associates itself with Christianity to say that it is okay to suggest that God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents, that God would condone putting children in cages has lost all claim to ever use religious language again.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Mr. vice president I don’t know if you raised your hand or word just asking to speak–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Look–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Would you decriminalize crossing the border without documents?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	The first thing I would do is unite families.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I would surge immediately billions of dollars’ worth of help to the region the immediately.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Look, I talk about foreign policy.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I am the guy that got a bipartisan agreement at the very end of the campaign, at the very end of our term to spend $740 million to deal with the problem and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	It was working.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We saw as you know a net decrease in the number of children who were coming.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	The crisis was updated and along came this President and he said he immediately discontinued that.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We all talk about these things, I did it.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I did it.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	740–now look, second thing–second thing we have to do, the law now requires the reuniting of those families.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We would reunite those families period and if not we would put those children in a circumstance where they were safe until we could find their parents.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And lastly the idea that he is in court with his Justice Department saying children in cages do not need a bed, do not need a blanket, do not need a toothbrush–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Vice President–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	That is outrageous.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	The Obama-Biden administration was– The Obama-Biden administration deported more than three million Americans.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	My question to you is if an individual is living in the United States of America without documents and that is his only offense, should that person be deported?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Depending if they committed a–a major crime, they should be deported.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And the President was left in his–President Obama I think did a heck of a job.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	To compare him to what–what this guy is doing is absolutely, I find–close to immoral.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	But the fact is that, look, we should not be locking people up.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We should be making sure we change the circumstance, as we did, why they would leave in the first place.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them, keep them safe until they can be heard.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	A 15-second, if you could, if you wish to answer, should someone who is here without documents, and that is his only offense, should that person be deported?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	That person should not be the focus of deportation.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We should fundamentally change the way we deal with things.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Senator?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I want to–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–I think it’s important–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Suggest that I agree with a lot of what Kamala just said, and that is on day one we take out our executive order pen and we rescind every damn thing on this issue that Trump has done.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Number two–number two, picking up on the point that Joe made, we got a look at the root causes.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And you have a situation where Honduras, among other things, is a failing state, massive corruption.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	You got gangs who are telling families that if a 10-year-old does not join their gang, their family is going to be killed.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	What we have got to do on day one and invite the presidents and the leadership of Central America and Mexico together.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	This is a hemispheric–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Thank you–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Problem that we have got to address.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Congressman Swalwell?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	What do you do?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Day one?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	No. If someone is here without documents and that is their only offense, is that person to be deported?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	No, that person can be a part of this great American experience.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	That person can contribute.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	My congressional district is one of the most diverse in America, and we see the benefits when people contribute and they become a part of the community and they’re not in the shadow economy.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Day one for me, families are reunited.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	This president, though, for immigrants, there is nothing he will not do two separate a family, cage a child, or erase their existence by weaponizing the census.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And there is nothing that we cannot do in the courts and that I will not do as president to reverse that and to make sure that families always belong together.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Senator Harris?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Well, thank you.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I will say, no, absolutely not.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	They should not be deported.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And I actually–this was one of the very few issues with which I disagreed with the administration, with whom I otherwise had a great relationship and a great deal of respect.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	But on the secure communities issue, I was Attorney General of California.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I led the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, in a state of 40 million people.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And on this issue, I disagreed with my president, because the policy was to allow deportation of people who, by ICE’s own definition, were non-criminals.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	So, as Attorney General and the chief law officer of the state of California, I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state that they did not have to comply with detainers and instead should make decisions based on the best interest of public safety of their community.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Because what I saw–and I was tracking it every day.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I was tracking it and saw that–that parents, people who had not committed a crime even by ICE’s own definition, were being deported.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And–but I have to add a point here.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	The problem with this kind of policy, and I know it as a prosecutor–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–I want a rape victim to be able to run in the middle–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Of a–to run in the middle of the street and waved down a police officer and report the crime against her.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I want anybody who has been the victim–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Of any real crime–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–To be able to do that–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Your time–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–And not be afraid that, if they do that–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–They will be deported because the abuser–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Will tell them it is they who is the criminal.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	It is wrong.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We’re going to turn–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–It is wrong–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–We’re going to turn to the issue of trade now, if we can.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Last night we ask the candidates on this stage to name the greatest geopolitical threat facing the U.S. Four of them mentioned China.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	U.S. businesses say China steals our intellectual property and party leaders on both sides accuse China of manipulating their currency to keep the cost of goods artificially low.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I’ll ask this to Senator Bennet to start off with, how would you stand up to China?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I think that, first of all, the biggest–the biggest threat to our national security right now is Russia, not China.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And, second, on China we’ve got comp–because of what they’ve done with our election.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	In China, I think the president’s been right to push back on China but he’s done it in completely the wrong way.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We should mobilize the entire rest of the world who all have a shared interest in pushing back on China’s mercantilist trade policies and I think we can do that.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I’d like to answer the other question before this as well.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	You–you have the time–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	When I–when I–when I see these kids at the border, I see my mom because I know she sees herself because she was separated from her parents for years during the holocaust in Poland.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And for Donald Trump to be doing what he’s doing to children and their families at the borders I say this as somebody who wrote the immigration bill in 2013 that created a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people in this country that had the most progressive DREAM Act that’s ever been conceived, much less passed, it got 68 votes in the Senate, that had $46 billion of border security in it that was sophisticated 21st century border security, not a medieval wall that the president has–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator, the time–sorry–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Turned the border of the United States into a symbol of nativist hostility that the whole world is looking at when what we should be represented by is–
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator, thank you.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–The Statue of Liberty, which has brought my parents to this country to begin with.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	We need to make a change.
	
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Mm-hmm.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	But, I also believe–and it’s personal.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	And I–I was actually very–it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on segregation of race in this country.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose bussing.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	And you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bussed to school every day and that little girl was me.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	So, I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among democrats.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	We have to take it seriously.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	We have to act swiftly.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	As attorney general of California, I was very proud to put in place a–a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Senator Harris, thank you.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Vice President Biden, you have been invoked.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	We are going to give you a chance to respond.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	That’s a mischaracterization of my position across the board.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I did not praise racists.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	That is not true, number one.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Number two, if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether I did or not, I’m happy to do that.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I was a public defender.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I didn’t become a prosecutor.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I came out and I left a good law firm to become a public defender when in fact — when in fact — when in fact my city was in flames because of the–the assassination of Dr. King, number one.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Now, number two, as the U.S.–as–excuse me–as the vice president of the United States, I worked with a man who in fact, we worked very hard to see to it we dealt with these issues in a major, major way.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	The fact is that in terms of busing, the busing, I never–you would’ve been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	That’s fine.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	That’s one of the things I argued for that we should not be–we should be breaking down these lines.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	But–so, the bottom line here is, look, everything I have done in my career–I ran because of civil rights.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	And those civil rights, by the way, include not just African Americans, but the LGBT community.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	They don’t–
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–But, Vice President Biden do you agree today–do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then?
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	No.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Do you agree?
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I did not oppose bussing in America.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	What I opposed is bussing ordered by the Department of Education.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	That’s what I opposed.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I did not oppose–
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–Well, there was a failure of–of states to–to integrate–
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–No, but–
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–Public schools in America.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I was part of the second class to integrate, Berkley, California Public Schools almost two decades after Brown v.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Board of Education.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Because your city council made that decision.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	It was a local decision.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	So, that’s where the federal government must step in.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	The–the federal government must–
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–That’s why we have the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	That’s why we need to pass the Equality Act.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	That’s why we need to pass the ERA because there are–
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–That–
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–Moments in-
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I have supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran for (INAUDIBLE).
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Vice President Biden 30 seconds because I want to bring other people into this.\
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I–I supported the ERA from the very beginning.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I am the guy that extended the voting rights act for 25 years.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	We got to the place where we got 98 out of 98 votes in the United States Senate doing it.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I have also argued very strongly that we in fact deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I agree that everybody once they in fact–my time is up.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I’m sorry.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Thank you vice president.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	All of these things (INAUDIBLE).

Klobuchar's rivals programs	Well, first, the economy.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	And Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what’s going on, when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	So I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	I do.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	But I think my plan is a good one.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	And my plan would be to, first of all, make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	My own dad and my sister got their first degrees with community college.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	There’s many paths to success, as well as certifications.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	Secondly, I’d used Pell grants.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	I’d double them from $6,000 to $12,000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered, to families that make up to $100,000.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	And then the third thing I would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	Because I can tell you this: If billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.
	
Top tax rate	This economy has got to work for everyone.
Top tax rate	And right now, we know that it isn’t.
Top tax rate	And it’s going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does.
Top tax rate	(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Right now, we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes.
Top tax rate	That’s how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest.
Top tax rate	A $2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality.
Top tax rate	A new democracy that is revived because we’ve returned power to the people, no PACs, no gerrymandering, automatic and same-day voter registration to bring in more voters, and a new Voting Rights Act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now…
Top tax rate	Congressman O’Rourke…
Top tax rate	That’s how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody.
Top tax rate	Congressman, that’s time, sir.
Top tax rate	I’ll give you 10 seconds to answer if you want to answer the direct question.
Top tax rate	Would you support a 70 percent individual marginal tax rate?
Top tax rate	Yes, no, or pass?
Top tax rate	I would support a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone.
Top tax rate	Tax capital at the same right…
Top tax rate	Seventy percent?
Top tax rate	… that you — you tax ordinary income.
Top tax rate	Take that corporate tax rate up to 28 percent.
Top tax rate	You would generate the revenues…
Top tax rate	OK, that’s time.
Top tax rate	… you need to pay for the programs we’re talking about.
	
breaking up of tech companies	I don’t think I disagree.
breaking up of tech companies	I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation.
breaking up of tech companies	And you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from labor, and we have people that work full-time jobs and still can’t make a living wage.
breaking up of tech companies	We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs.
breaking up of tech companies	And you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that’s hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete.
breaking up of tech companies	One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector.
breaking up of tech companies	So I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work.
breaking up of tech companies	And I’ll tell you this.
breaking up of tech companies	I live in a low-income black and brown community.
breaking up of tech companies	I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans.
breaking up of tech companies	The indicators that are being used, from GDP to Wall Street’s rankings, is not helping people in my community.
breaking up of tech companies	It is about time that we have an economy that works for everybody, not just the wealthiest in our nation.
breaking up of tech companies	But quickly, Senator Booker, you did say that you didn’t think it was right to name names, to name companies and single them out, as Senator Warren has.
breaking up of tech companies	Briefly, why is that?
breaking up of tech companies	Well, again, I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that.
breaking up of tech companies	And when it comes to antitrust law, what I will do is, number one, appoint judges that will enforce it, number two, have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration.
breaking up of tech companies	At the end of the day, we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing.
breaking up of tech companies	We see that with everything from Citizens United and the way they’re trying to influence Washington.
breaking up of tech companies	It’s about time that we have a president that fights for the people in this country…
breaking up of tech companies	That’s time, sir.
breaking up of tech companies	We need to have someone that’s a champion for them.
breaking up of tech companies	Thank you, Senator.
breaking up of tech companies	Senator Warren, I mentioned you … Are you picking winners and losers?
breaking up of tech companies	So the way I understand this, it’s there is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country.
breaking up of tech companies	That hurts workers.
breaking up of tech companies	It hurts small businesses.
breaking up of tech companies	It hurts independent farmers.
breaking up of tech companies	It hurts our economy overall.
breaking up of tech companies	And it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy.
breaking up of tech companies	Now, look, we’ve had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back.
breaking up of tech companies	What’s been missing is courage, courage in Washington to take on the giants.
breaking up of tech companies	That’s part of the corruption in this system.
breaking up of tech companies	It has been far too long that the monopolies have been making the campaign contributions, have been funding the super PACs, have been out there making sure that their influence is heard and felt in every single decision that gets made in Washington.
breaking up of tech companies	Where I want to start this is I want to return government to the people, and that means calling out the names of the monopolists and saying I have the courage to go after them.
	
Gender Pay gap	Thank you very much for that question, Lester.
Gender Pay gap	You know, I grew up with a mother who raised my brother, Joaquin, and me as a single parent.
Gender Pay gap	And I know what it’s like to struggle.
Gender Pay gap	I know what it’s like to rent a home and to worry about whether you’re going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month and to see a mom work very, very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because they’re women.
Gender Pay gap	I would do several things, starting with something we should have done a long time ago, which is to pass the Equal Rights Amendment finally in this country.
Gender Pay gap	And also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country.
Gender Pay gap	It’s past time that we did that.
Gender Pay gap	And, you know, we have to do this.
Gender Pay gap	If we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century, we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve.
Gender Pay gap	All right, thank you.
Gender Pay gap	I want to put the same question to Congresswoman Gabbard.
Gender Pay gap	Your thoughts on equal pay?
	
Income Inequality	BLASIO: Well, we’ve been addressing income inequality in New York City by raising wages, by raising benefits, by putting money back in the hands of working people, $15 minimum wage, paid sick days, pre-K for all, things that are making a huge difference in working people’s lives.
Income Inequality	But let me tell you, what we’re hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle for the heart and soul of our party.
Income Inequality	I want to make it clear.
Income Inequality	This is supposed to be the party of working people.
Income Inequality	Yes, we’re supposed to be for a 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy.
Income Inequality	Yes, we’re supposed to be for free college, free public college, for our young people.
Income Inequality	We are supposed to break up big corporations when they’re not serving our democracy.
Income Inequality	This Democratic Party has to be strong and bold and progressive.
Income Inequality	And in New York, we’ve proven that we can do something very different, we can put money back in the hands of working people.
Income Inequality	And let me tell you, every time you talk about investing in people and their communities, you hear folks say there’s not enough money.
Income Inequality	What I say to them every single time is, there’s plenty of money in this world, there’s plenty of money in this country.
Income Inequality	It’s just in the wrong hands.
Income Inequality	Democrats have to fix that.
Income Inequality	(APPLAUSE)
Income Inequality	Congressman Delaney, do you agree?
Income Inequality	I think we have to do real things to help American workers and the American people.
Income Inequality	Right?
Income Inequality	This is the issue that all of us hear on the campaign trail.
Income Inequality	We need to make sure everyone has a living wage.
Income Inequality	And I’ve called for a doubling of the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating paid family leave.
Income Inequality	That will create a situation where people actually have a living wage.
Income Inequality	That gets right to workers.
Income Inequality	Then we’ve got to fix our public education system.
Income Inequality	It’s not delivering the results our kids needs, nor is college and post high school career and technical training programs doing that.
Income Inequality	You know, I’m very different than everyone else here on the stage.
Income Inequality	Prior to being in Congress, I was an entrepreneur.
Income Inequality	I started two businesses.
Income Inequality	I created thousands of jobs.
Income Inequality	I spent my whole career helping small- to mid-sized businesses all over the country, 5,000 of them I supported.
Income Inequality	The Obama administration gave me an award for lending to disadvantaged communities.
Income Inequality	I know how to create jobs.
Income Inequality	We need a short-term strategy which is to put money in the pockets of workers with the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating family leave, and then we need to have a long-term strategy to make sure this country is competitive and we’re creating jobs everywhere in this country.
Income Inequality	Thank you.
Income Inequality	Governor Inslee, how would you address income inequality?
	
Manufacturing Jobs	Yes, I believe you can, but, first, let’s say the president came, he said don’t sell your house to people in Youngstown, Ohio.
Manufacturing Jobs	And then his administration just in the last two years, we lost $4,000 — 4,000 jobs at a General Motors facility.
Manufacturing Jobs	That rippled throughout our community.
Manufacturing Jobs	General Motors got a tax cut.
Manufacturing Jobs	General Motors got a bailout.
Manufacturing Jobs	And then they have the audacity to move a new car that they’re going to produce to Mexico.
Manufacturing Jobs	I’ve had family members that have to unbolt a machine from the factory floor, put it in a box, and ship it to China.
Manufacturing Jobs	My area where I come from in northeast Ohio, this issue we’re talking about here, it’s been going on 40 years.
Manufacturing Jobs	This is not a new phenomenon in the United States of America.
Manufacturing Jobs	The bottom 60 percent haven’t seen a raise since 1980.
Manufacturing Jobs	Meanwhile, the top 1 percent control 90 percent of the wealth.
Manufacturing Jobs	We need an industrial policy saying we’re going to dominate building electric vehicles, there’s going to be 30 million made in the next 10 years.
Manufacturing Jobs	I want half of them made in the United States.
Manufacturing Jobs	I want to dominate the solar industry…
Manufacturing Jobs	Thank you.
Manufacturing Jobs	… and manufacture those here in the United States.
Manufacturing Jobs	Senator Warren, are they coming back?
Manufacturing Jobs	Are these jobs coming back?
Manufacturing Jobs	So we’ve had an industrial policy in the United States for decades now, and it’s basically been let giant corporations do whatever they want to do.
Manufacturing Jobs	Giant corporations have exactly one loyalty, and that is to profits.
Manufacturing Jobs	And if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to Canada, they’re going to do it.
Manufacturing Jobs	So here’s what I propose for an industrial policy.
Manufacturing Jobs	Start with a place where there’s a real need.
Manufacturing Jobs	There’s going to be a worldwide need for green technology, ways to clean up the air, ways to clean up the water.
Manufacturing Jobs	And we can be the ones to provide that.
Manufacturing Jobs	We need to go tenfold in our research and development on green energy going forward.
Manufacturing Jobs	And then we need to say any corporation can come and use that research.
Manufacturing Jobs	They can make all kinds of products from it, but they have to be manufactured right here in the United States of America.
Manufacturing Jobs	And then we have to double down and sell it around the world.
Manufacturing Jobs	There’s a $23 trillion market coming for green products.
Manufacturing Jobs	We should be the leaders and the owners, and we should have that 1.2 million manufacturing jobs here in America.
Manufacturing Jobs	Thank you.
	
Healthcare	Well, I think it’s a bold approach.
Healthcare	It’s something that Barack Obama wanted to do when we were working on the Affordable Care Act.
Healthcare	And that is a public option.
Healthcare	I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in four years, which is exactly what this bill says.
Healthcare	So let me go on beyond that.
Healthcare	There is a much bigger issue in addition to that, and that is pharmaceuticals.
Healthcare	The president literally went on TV, on Fox, and said that people’s heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices.
Healthcare	Instead, 2,500 drugs have gone up in double-digits since he came into office.
Healthcare	Instead, he gave $100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies.
Healthcare	For the rest of us, for the rest of America, that’s what we call at home all foam and no beer.
Healthcare	We got nothing out of it.
Healthcare	And so my proposal is to do something about pharma, to take them on, to allow negotiation under Medicare, to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries.
Healthcare	And pharma thinks they own Washington?
Healthcare	Well, they don’t own me.
Healthcare	Your time is up.
Healthcare	Thank you.
Healthcare	Senator Warren, you signed on to Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for all plan.
Healthcare	It would put essentially everybody on Medicare and then eliminate private plans that offer similar coverage.
Healthcare	Is that the plan or path that you would pursue as president?
Healthcare	So, yes.
Healthcare	I’m with Bernie on Medicare for all.
Healthcare	And let me tell you why.
Healthcare	I spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke.
Healthcare	And one of the number-one reasons is the cost of health care, medical bills.
Healthcare	And that’s not just for people who don’t have insurance.
Healthcare	It’s for people who have insurance.
Healthcare	Look at the business model of an insurance company.
Healthcare	It’s to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your health care.
Healthcare	That leaves families with rising premiums, rising copays, and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the health care that their doctors say that they and their children need.
Healthcare	Medicare for all solves that problem.
Healthcare	And I understand.
Healthcare	There are a lot of politicians who say, oh, it’s just not possible, we just can’t do it, have a lot of political reasons for this.
Healthcare	What they’re really telling you is they just won’t fight for it.
Healthcare	Well, health care is a basic human right, and I will fight for basic human rights…
Healthcare	Congressman O’Rourke, when you ran for Senate, you also praised a bill that would replace private insurance.
Healthcare	This year, you’re saying you’re no longer sure.
Healthcare	Can you explain why?
Healthcare	My goal is to ensure that every American is well enough to live to their full potential because they have health care.
Healthcare	In Laredo, Texas, I met a young man, 27 years old, told me that he’d been to a doctor once in his life.
Healthcare	And on that visit, he was told he had diabetes, he was told he had glaucoma, and he was told untreated — because he doesn’t have health care — he’ll be dead before the age of 40.
Healthcare	So getting to guaranteed, high-quality, universal health care as quickly and surely as possible has to be our goal.
Healthcare	The ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider, to be — the ability to see a mental health care provider.
Healthcare	In Texas, the single largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system today.
Healthcare	And health care also has to mean that every woman can make her own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible.
Healthcare	Our plan says that if you’re uninsured, we enroll you in Medicare.
Healthcare	If you’re insufficiently insured, you can’t afford your premiums, we enroll you in Medicare.
Healthcare	But if you’re a member of a union that negotiated for a health care plan that you like because it works for you and your family, you’re able to keep it.
Healthcare	Your time is up.
Healthcare	We preserve choice by making sure everybody has care.
Healthcare	Your time is up, Congressman, but I do want to ask a follow-up on this.
Healthcare	Just to be very clear — I’ll give you 10 seconds — would you replace private insurance?
Healthcare	No. I think the choice is fundamental to our ability to get everybody cared for…
Healthcare	BLASIO: Wait, wait, wait.
Healthcare	Congressman O’Rourke, Congressman O’Rourke, private insurance is not working for tens of millions of Americans when you talk about the co-pays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out of pocket expenses.
Healthcare	It’s not working.
Healthcare	How can you defend a system that’s not working?
Healthcare	That’s right.
Healthcare	So for those for whom it’s not working, they can choose Medicare.
Healthcare	For the…
Healthcare	BLASIO: Congressman…
Healthcare	… who I listen to…
Healthcare	BLASIO: … you’ve got to start by acknowledging the system is not working for people.
Healthcare	… they’re able to keep them.
Healthcare	BLASIO: Why are you defending private insurance to begin with?
Healthcare	… 100 million Americans say they like their private health insurance, by the way.
Healthcare	It should be noted that 100 million Americans — I mean, I think we should be the party that keeps what’s working and fixes what’s broken.
Healthcare	I mean, doesn’t that make sense?
Healthcare	I mean, we should give everyone in this country health care as a basic human right for free, full stop.
Healthcare	But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance.
Healthcare	Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people?
Healthcare	And also it’s bad policy.
Healthcare	If you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question, which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate?
Healthcare	Every single hospital administrator said they would close.
Healthcare	And the Medicare for all bill requires payments to stay at current Medicare rates.
Healthcare	So to some extent, we’re supporting a bill that will have every hospital closing.
Healthcare	I mean, my dad was a union electrician, right?
Healthcare	I actually grew up in a working-class family.
Healthcare	He loved the health care that the IBEW gave him.
Healthcare	And I just always think about my dad in anything I would do from a policy perspective.
Healthcare	He’d look at me and he’d say, good job, John, for getting health care for every American.
Healthcare	But why are you taking my health care away?
Healthcare	I’ve let this — I’ve let this play out a little bit because I’m fascinated to hear the daylight between you.
Healthcare	Congresswoman Gabbard, why don’t you weigh in here?
Healthcare	I think we’re talking about this in the wrong way.
Healthcare	You’re talking about one bill over another bill.
Healthcare	Really, what we’re talking about is our objective, making sure that every single sick American in this country is able to get the health care that they need.
Healthcare	I believe Medicare for all is the way to do that.
Healthcare	I also think that employers will recognize how much money will be saved by supporting a Medicare for all program, a program that will reduce the administrative costs, reduce the bureaucratic costs, and make sure that everyone gets that quality health care that they need.
Healthcare	I also think that…
Healthcare	Senator…
Healthcare	… if you — if you look at other countries in the world who have universal health care, every one of them has some form of a role of private insurance, so I think that’s what we’ve got to look at, taking the best of these ideas, but making sure unequivocally that no sick American goes without getting the care that they need, regardless of how much or little money they have in their pocket.
Healthcare	Congresswoman, Congresswoman, thanks.
Healthcare	Let me turn to Senator Booker on this.
Healthcare	Senator Booker, explain to me where you are.
Healthcare	This is hugely important to people.
Healthcare	So tell us where you are.
Healthcare	I absolutely will.
Healthcare	First of all, we’re talking about this as a health care issue, but in communities like mine, low-income communities, it’s an education issue, because kids who don’t have health care are not going to succeed in school.
Healthcare	It is an issue for jobs and employment, because people who do not have good health care do not succeed at work.
Healthcare	It’s even a retirement issue, because in my community, African-Americans have a lower life expectancy because of poorer health care.
Healthcare	And so where I stand is very clear.
Healthcare	Health care — it’s not just a human right, it should be an American right.
Healthcare	And I believe the best way to get there is Medicare for all.
Healthcare	But I have an urgency about this.
Healthcare	When I am president of the United States, I’m not going to wait.
Healthcare	We have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care.
Healthcare	And on this debate, I’m sorry.
Healthcare	There are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America, from pharmaceutical companies to insurers.
Healthcare	Literally, the overhead for insurance that they charge is 15 percent, while Medicare’s overhead is only at 2 percent.
Healthcare	We can do this better.
Healthcare	And every single day, I will be fighting to give people more access and more affordable costs until we get to my goal…
Healthcare	Your time is up, Senator.
Healthcare	… which is every American having health care.
Healthcare	Time is up, Senator.
Healthcare	I want to…
Healthcare	I want to move back, if I can, to Congresswoman Gabbard…
Healthcare	… point, though, and that is that the insurance companies last year alone sucked $23 billion in profits out of the health care system, $23 billion.
Healthcare	And that doesn’t count the money that was paid to executives, the money that was spent lobbying Washington.
Healthcare	We have a giant industry that wants our health care system to stay the way it is, because it’s not working for families, but it’s sure as heck working for them.
	
Abortion	It should not be an option in the United States of America for any insurance company to deny a woman coverage for their exercise of their right of choice.
Abortion	And I am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a woman’s right of reproductive health in health insurance, and I’m the only candidate who has passed a public option.
Abortion	And I respect everybody’s goals and plans here, but we do have one candidate that’s actually advanced the ball.
Abortion	And we’ve got to have access for everyone.
Abortion	I’ve done it as a public option.
Abortion	Your time…
Abortion	Senator Klobuchar, I want to get you…
Abortion	That’s a false claim.
Abortion	I am fascinated by this.
Abortion	Senator — Senator Klobuchar?
Abortion	I just want to say, there’s three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a woman’s right to choose.
Abortion	I’ll start with that.
Abortion	And then I just want to make very clear, I think we share the goal of universal health care.
Abortion	And the idea I put out there, the public option, which the governor was just talking about, this idea is that you use Medicare or Medicaid without any insurance companies involved, you can do it either way.
Abortion	And the estimates are 13 million people would see a reduction in their premiums, 12 more million people would get covered.
Abortion	So I think it is a beginning and the way you start and the way you move to universal health care.
Abortion	Secretary Castro, this one is for you.
Abortion	All of you on stage support a woman’s right to an abortion.
Abortion	You all support some version of a government health care option.
Abortion	Would your plan cover abortion, Mr. Secretary?
Abortion	Yes, it would.
Abortion	I don’t believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice.
Abortion	And, you know, what that means is that just because a woman — or let’s also not forget someone in the trans community, a trans female, is poor, doesn’t mean they shouldn’t have the right to exercise that right to choose.
Abortion	And so I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion.
Abortion	More than that, everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today, a person’s right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri, in Alabama, in Georgia.
Abortion	I would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of Roe v.
Abortion	Wade and will respect it.… and in addition to that, make sure that we fight hard as we transition our health care system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right.
Abortion	Senator Warren, would you put limits on — any limits on abortion?
Abortion	I would make certain that every woman has access to the full range of reproductive health care services, and that includes birth control, it includes abortion, it includes everything for a woman.
Abortion	And I want to add on that.
Abortion	It’s not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us.
Abortion	Forty-seven years ago, Roe v.
Abortion	Wade was decided, and we’ve all looked to the courts all that time, as state after state has undermined Roe, has put in exceptions, has come right up to the edge of taking away protections.
Abortion	Your time is up, Senator.
	
Opiod Crisis	They should absolutely be held criminally liable, because they are liable and responsible.
Opiod Crisis	This is one of the reasons why well before I was running for president I said I would not take contributions from pharma companies, not take contributions from corporate PACs, or pharma executives, because they are part of this problem.
Opiod Crisis	And this opioid addiction in our country, we in cities like mine have been seeing how we’ve tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long.
Opiod Crisis	It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that.
Opiod Crisis	Congressman O’Rourke, how would you deal with it?
Opiod Crisis	Tonight in this country, you have 2.3 million of our fellow Americans behind bars.
Opiod Crisis	It’s the largest prison population on the face of the planet.
Opiod Crisis	Many are there for nonviolent drug crimes, including possession of marijuana, at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized it.
Opiod Crisis	And yet despite what Purdue Pharma has done, their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we’re seeing throughout this country, they’ve been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences, not a single night in jail.
Opiod Crisis	Unless there’s accountability and justice, this crisis will continue.
Opiod Crisis	In my administration, we will hold them to account.
Opiod Crisis	We will make sure that they pay a price, and we will help those who’ve been victims of this malfeasance in this country get them treatment and long-term care.
	
Undocumented Immigrants	Thank you very much, Jose.
Undocumented Immigrants	I’m very proud that in April I became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan.
Undocumented Immigrants	And we saw those images… … watching that image of Oscar and his daughter, Valeria, is heartbreaking.
Undocumented Immigrants	It should also piss us all off.
Undocumented Immigrants	If I were president today — and it should spur us to action.
Undocumented Immigrants	If I were president today, I would sign an executive order that would get rid of Trump’s zero-tolerance policy, the remain in Mexico policy, and the metering policy — this metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river.
Undocumented Immigrants	They had been playing games with people who are coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry.
Undocumented Immigrants	Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry, and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim, so they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river, and they died because of that.
Undocumented Immigrants	On day one.
Undocumented Immigrants	Sorry, I’m just going to ask…
Undocumented Immigrants	On day one, I would do that executive order that would address metering.
Undocumented Immigrants	And then I would follow that up in my first 100 days with immigration reform that would honor asylum claims, that would put undocumented immigrants, as long as they haven’t committed a serious crime, on a pathway to citizenship.
Undocumented Immigrants	And then we’d get to the root cause of the issue, which is we need a Marshall Plan for Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of coming to the United States to seek it.
Undocumented Immigrants	Senator Booker, what would you do on day one?
Undocumented Immigrants	And this is a situation that the next president will inherit.
Undocumented Immigrants	Senator Booker, what would you do on day one?
Undocumented Immigrants	And this is a situation that the next president will inherit.
Undocumented Immigrants	Yes.
Undocumented Immigrants	(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) On day one, I will make sure that, number one, we end the ICE policies and the Customs and Border Policies that are violating the human rights.
Undocumented Immigrants	When people come to this country, they do not leave their human rights at the border.
Undocumented Immigrants	Number two…I will make sure that we reinstate DACA, that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for DACA recipients, and to make sure that people that are here on temporary protective status can stay and remain here.
Undocumented Immigrants	And then, finally, we need to make sure that we address the issues that made Oscar and Valeria come in the first place, by making major investments in the Northern Triangle, not like this president is doing, by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem.
Undocumented Immigrants	We cannot surrender our values and think that we’re going to get border security.
Undocumented Immigrants	We actually will lose security and our values.
Undocumented Immigrants	We must fight for both.
Undocumented Immigrants	… if I might — if I might, very briefly, and this is an important point.
Undocumented Immigrants	You know, my plan — and I’m glad to see that Senator Booker, Senator Warren, and Governor Inslee agree with me on this.
Undocumented Immigrants	My plan also includes getting rid of Section 1325 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, to go back to the way we used to treat this when somebody comes across the border, not to criminalize desperation, to treat that as a civil violation.
Undocumented Immigrants	And here’s why it’s important.
Undocumented Immigrants	We see all of this horrendous family separation.
Undocumented Immigrants	They use that law, Section 1325, to justify under the law separating little children from their families.
Undocumented Immigrants	Thank you.
Undocumented Immigrants	Jose…
Undocumented Immigrants	And so I want to challenge every single candidate on this stage to support the repeal of Section 1325.
Undocumented Immigrants	Thirty seconds.
Undocumented Immigrants	As my friend here said, I agree with him on that issue, but folks should understand that the separation of children from families doesn’t just go on at our border.
Undocumented Immigrants	It happens in our communities, as ICE are ripping away parents from their American children, spouses and the like, and are creating fear in cities all across this country where parents are afraid to even drop their kids off to school or go to work.
Undocumented Immigrants	We must end those policies, as well.
Undocumented Immigrants	BLASIO: We have to change the discussion about in this country…
Undocumented Immigrants	Mayor?
Undocumented Immigrants	BLASIO: … because look at the bottom line here.
Undocumented Immigrants	Those tragic — that tragic photo of those — that parent, that child — and I’m saying this as a father.
Undocumented Immigrants	Every American should feel that in their heart, every American should say that is not America, those are not our values.
Undocumented Immigrants	But we have to get under the skin of why we have this crisis in our system, because we’re not being honest about the division that’s been fomented in this country.
Undocumented Immigrants	The way that American citizens have been told that immigrants somehow created their misery and their pain and their challenges, for all the American citizens out there who feel you’re falling behind or feel the American dream is not working for you, the immigrants didn’t do that to you.
Undocumented Immigrants	The big corporations did that to you.
Undocumented Immigrants	The 1 percent did that to you.
Undocumented Immigrants	We need to be the party of working people, and that includes a party of immigrants.
Undocumented Immigrants	But first we have to tell working people in America who are hurting that we’re going to be on their side every single time against those big corporations who created this mess to begin with.
Undocumented Immigrants	And remind people we’re all in this together.
Undocumented Immigrants	If we don’t change that debate, that politics that’s holding us back, we won’t get all these reforms people are talking about.
Undocumented Immigrants	That’s what we need to do as Democrats.
Undocumented Immigrants	If I could, I’m sorry.
Undocumented Immigrants	(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) What would you do, Congressman, day one at the White House??
Undocumented Immigrants	(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) We would not turn back Valeria and her father, Oscar.
Undocumented Immigrants	We would accept them into this country and follow our own asylum laws.
Undocumented Immigrants	We would not build walls.
Undocumented Immigrants	We would not put kids in cages.
Undocumented Immigrants	In fact, we would spare no expense to reunite the families that have been separated already…
Undocumented Immigrants	… and we would not criminally prosecute any family who is fleeing violence and persecution…
Undocumented Immigrants	… repeal of Section 1325.
Undocumented Immigrants	We would make sure…
Undocumented Immigrants	Secretary, let him finish.
Undocumented Immigrants	And I will give you…
Undocumented Immigrants	But let him finish.
Undocumented Immigrants	Let him finish.
Undocumented Immigrants	We would not detain any family fleeing violence, in fact, fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet today.
Undocumented Immigrants	We would implement a family case management program so they could be cared for in the community at a fraction of the cost.
Undocumented Immigrants	And then we would rewrite our immigration laws in our own image, free Dreamers forever from any fear of deportation by making them U.S. citizens here in this country, invest in solutions in Central America, work with regional stakeholders so there’s no reason to make that 2,000 mile journey to this country.
Undocumented Immigrants	Thank you.
Undocumented Immigrants	Secretary, I’ll give you 30 seconds.
Undocumented Immigrants	Let’s be very clear.
Undocumented Immigrants	The reason that they’re separating these little children from their families is that they’re using Section 1325 of that act which criminalizes coming across the border to incarcerate the parents and then separate them.
Undocumented Immigrants	Some of us on this stage have called to end that section, to terminate it.
Undocumented Immigrants	Some, like Congressman O’Rourke, have not.
Undocumented Immigrants	And I want to challenge all of the candidate to do that.
Undocumented Immigrants	I just think it’s a mistake, Beto.
Undocumented Immigrants	I think it’s a mistake.
Undocumented Immigrants	And I think that — that if you truly want to change the system, that we’ve got to repeal that section.
Undocumented Immigrants	If not…
Undocumented Immigrants	Thank you.
Undocumented Immigrants	… then it might as well be the same policy.
Undocumented Immigrants	Let me respond to this very briefly.
Undocumented Immigrants	As a member of a Congress, I helped to introduce legislation that would ensure that we don’t criminalize those who are seeking asylum and refuge in this country.
Undocumented Immigrants	I’m not talking about — I’m not talking about the ones that are seeking asylum.
Undocumented Immigrants	If you’re fleeing — if you’re fleeing desperation, then I want to make sure…
Undocumented Immigrants	I’m talking about — I’m talking about everybody else.
Undocumented Immigrants	… I want to make sure you are treated with respect.
Undocumented Immigrants	I’m still talking about everybody else.
Undocumented Immigrants	But you’re looking at just one small part of this.
Undocumented Immigrants	I’m talking about a comprehensive rewrite of our immigration laws.
Undocumented Immigrants	That’s not true.
Undocumented Immigrants	And if you do that, I don’t think it’s asking too much for people to follow our laws when they come to this country.
Undocumented Immigrants	That’s actually not true.
Undocumented Immigrants	I’m talking about millions of folks — a lot of folks that are coming are not seeking asylum.
Undocumented Immigrants	A lot of them are undocumented immigrants, right?
Undocumented Immigrants	And you said recently that the reason you didn’t want to repeal Section 1325 was because you were concerned about human trafficking and drug trafficking.
Undocumented Immigrants	But let me tell you what: Section 18, title 18 of the U.S. code, title 21 and title 22, already cover human trafficking.
Undocumented Immigrants	I think that you should do your homework on this issue.
Undocumented Immigrants	If you did your homework on this issue, you would know that we should repeal this section.
Undocumented Immigrants	This is an issue that we should and could be talking about for a long time, and we will for a long time.
Undocumented Immigrants	Can we talk about the conditions about why people are coming here?
Undocumented Immigrants	Let’s — Lester — Lester — I’m sorry, Savannah — I know, it’s just — we could go on.
Undocumented Immigrants	But rather than talk about specific provisions, we really have to talk about why these people are coming to our country…
Undocumented Immigrants	You’ll get your chance.
Undocumented Immigrants	… and what we’re going to do to actually make a difference in these countries.
Undocumented Immigrants	Congressman, you’ll get your chance.
Undocumented Immigrants	Let’s continue the discussion.
Undocumented Immigrants	Senator Klobuchar…
Undocumented Immigrants	Yes.
Undocumented Immigrants	Let’s talk about what Secretary Castro just said.
Undocumented Immigrants	He wants to no longer have it be a crime to illegally cross the border.
Undocumented Immigrants	Do you support that?
Undocumented Immigrants	Do you think it should be a civil offense only?
Undocumented Immigrants	And if so, do you worry about potentially incentivizing people to come here?
Undocumented Immigrants	Immigrants, they do not diminish America.
Undocumented Immigrants	They are America.
Undocumented Immigrants	And I am happy to look at his proposal.
Undocumented Immigrants	But I do think you want to make sure that you have provisions in place that allow you to go after traffickers and allow you to go after people who are violating the law.
Undocumented Immigrants	What I really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here.
Undocumented Immigrants	And that is that 70 of our Fortune 500 companies are headed by people that came from other countries.
Undocumented Immigrants	Twenty-five percent of our U.S. Nobel laureates were born in other countries.
Undocumented Immigrants	We have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories.
Undocumented Immigrants	We need them to start small businesses.
Undocumented Immigrants	We need their ideas.
Undocumented Immigrants	And this president has literally gone backwards at a time when our economy needs immigrants.
Undocumented Immigrants	And so my proposal is to look at that 2013 bill that passed the Senate with Republican support, to upgrade that bill, to make it as good as possible and get it done.
Undocumented Immigrants	It brings the doubt down by $158 billion.
Undocumented Immigrants	Senator…
Undocumented Immigrants	It gives a path for citizenship for citizen — for people who can become citizens.
Undocumented Immigrants	And it will be so much better for our economy in America.
Undocumented Immigrants	Senator, that’s time.
Undocumented Immigrants	Thank you.
Undocumented Immigrants	Congressman Ryan, same question.
Undocumented Immigrants	Should it be a crime to illegally cross the border?
Undocumented Immigrants	Or should it be a civil offense only?
Undocumented Immigrants	Well, I agree with Secretary Castro.
Undocumented Immigrants	I think there are other provisions in the law that will allow you to prosecute people for coming over here if they’re dealing drugs and other things.
Undocumented Immigrants	That’s already established in the law.
Undocumented Immigrants	So there’s no need to repeat it.
Undocumented Immigrants	And I think it’s abhorrent — we’re talking about this father who got killed with his daughter, and the issues here — the way these kids are being treated.
Undocumented Immigrants	If you go to Guantanamo Bay, there are terrorists that are held that get better health care than those kids that have tried to cross the border in the United States.
Undocumented Immigrants	That needs to stop.
Undocumented Immigrants	And I think the president should immediately ask doctors and nurses to go immediately down to the border and start taking care of these kids.
Undocumented Immigrants	What kind of country are we running here where we have a president of the United States who’s so focused on hate and fear and division?
Undocumented Immigrants	And what has happened now, the end result is now we’ve got kids literally laying in their own snot, with three-week-old diapers that haven’t been changed.
Undocumented Immigrants	We’ve got to tell this president that is not a sign of strength, Mr. President.
Undocumented Immigrants	That is a sign of weakness.
Undocumented Immigrants	Senator Booker — a lot of people — they asked the question, if you’re president on day one, what will you do with the fact that you will have families here?
Undocumented Immigrants	There’s been a lot of talk about what you’ll do in the first 100 days about legislation.
Undocumented Immigrants	What will you actually do with these families?
Undocumented Immigrants	How will you care for them?
Undocumented Immigrants	Will they be detained or will they not be?
Undocumented Immigrants	Well, this is a related and brief point, because what we’re talking — what Secretary Castro and I are talking about is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process.
Undocumented Immigrants	I have been to some of the largest private prisons, which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration, and their immigration lockups.
Undocumented Immigrants	Our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things, whether it’s immigration, whether it’s mental illness, whether it’s addiction.
Undocumented Immigrants	We know that this is not the way to deal with problems.
Undocumented Immigrants	There is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solves this problem.
Undocumented Immigrants	Donald Trump isn’t solving this problem.
Undocumented Immigrants	We’ve seen under his leadership a surge at our border.
Undocumented Immigrants	We solve this problem by making investments in the Northern Triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place, and we make sure we use our resources to provide health care to affirm the values and human dignity of the people that come here, because we cannot sacrifice our values, our ideals as a nation for border security.
Undocumented Immigrants	We can have both by doing this the right way.
Undocumented Immigrants	All right, Senator, thank you.
Undocumented Immigrants	Let me go to Governor Inslee on this.
Undocumented Immigrants	What would you do on day one?
Undocumented Immigrants	Same question I just asked Cory Booker.
Undocumented Immigrants	I have yet to hear an answer from anyone on this stage.
Undocumented Immigrants	There is no reason…
Undocumented Immigrants	What will you do with the families that will be here?
Undocumented Immigrants	There is no reason for the detention and separation of these children.
Undocumented Immigrants	They should be released, pending their hearings, and they should have a hearing and the law should be followed.
Undocumented Immigrants	That’s what should happen.
Undocumented Immigrants	And we should do what we’re doing in Washington state.
Undocumented Immigrants	I’m proud that we’ve passed a law that prevents local law enforcement from being turned into mini-ICE agents.
Undocumented Immigrants	I’m proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump’s heinous Muslim ban.
Undocumented Immigrants	I’m proud to be a person who’s not only talked about Dreamers, but being one of the first to make sure that they get a college education, so that they can realize their dreams.
Undocumented Immigrants	These are some of the most inspirational people in our state.
Undocumented Immigrants	And I’ll leave you with this thought, if you want to know what I think.
Undocumented Immigrants	Donald Trump the other day tried to threaten me — he thought it was a threat — to tell me that he would send refugees into Washington state if we passed a law that I passed.
Undocumented Immigrants	And I told him that’s not a threat at all.
Undocumented Immigrants	We welcome refugees into our state.
Undocumented Immigrants	We recognize diversity as a strength.
Undocumented Immigrants	This is how we’ve built America.
Undocumented Immigrants	That tradition is going to continue if I’m president of the United States.
Undocumented Immigrants	We’re going to switch to another topic now.
Undocumented Immigrants	We’ve got a lot to get to.
Undocumented Immigrants	Let’s…
	
Iran Nuclear Deal	May I address that?
Iran Nuclear Deal	First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal.
Iran Nuclear Deal	And one of the reasons why we’re seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation.
Iran Nuclear Deal	Literally, he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years.
Iran Nuclear Deal	And now we see Iran threatening to go further and who are pulled — being pulled further and further into this crisis.
Iran Nuclear Deal	We need to renegotiate and get back into a deal, but I’m not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally I’m going to rejoin that deal.
Iran Nuclear Deal	Because when I’m president of the United States, I’m going to do the best I can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if I have an opportunity to leverage a better deal, I’m going to do it.
Iran Nuclear Deal	All right, Senator Klobuchar, I’d like to ask you to answer that question, because you’ve said — you’ve said you would negotiate yourself back into the Iranian agreement.
Iran Nuclear Deal	Can you argue that that nuclear pact as it was ratified was a good deal?
Iran Nuclear Deal	Yes, it was.
Iran Nuclear Deal	It was imperfect, but it was a good deal for that moment.
Iran Nuclear Deal	I would have worked to get longer sunset periods, and that’s something we could negotiate, to get back in the deal.
Iran Nuclear Deal	But the point is, Donald Trump told us when he got out of it that he was going to give us a better deal.
Iran Nuclear Deal	Those were his words.
Iran Nuclear Deal	And now we are a month away from the Iranians, who claim now that they’re going blow the caps on enriching uranium.
Iran Nuclear Deal	And the Iranians have told us this.
Iran Nuclear Deal	And so that’s where we are now.
Iran Nuclear Deal	He has made us less safe than we were when he became president.
Iran Nuclear Deal	So what I would do is negotiate us back into that agreement, is stand with our allies, and not give unlimited leverage to China and Russia, which is what he has done.
Iran Nuclear Deal	And then, finally, I would make sure that if there is any possibility of a conflict — and we’re having this debate in Congress right now — that he comes to Congress for an authorization of military force.
Iran Nuclear Deal	I would do that.
Iran Nuclear Deal	And this president is literally every single day 10 minutes away from going to war, one tweet away from going to war.
Iran Nuclear Deal	And I don’t think we should conduct…
Iran Nuclear Deal	All right, your time is up.
Iran Nuclear Deal	… foreign policy in our bathrobe at 5:00 in the morning, which is what he does.
Iran Nuclear Deal	Congresswoman Gabbard, Congresswoman Gabbard, you’ve said you would sign back on to the 2015 deal.
Iran Nuclear Deal	Would you — would you insist, though, that it address Iran’s support for Hezbollah?
Iran Nuclear Deal	Let’s deal with the situation where we are, where this president and his chickenhawk cabinet have led us to the brink of war with Iran.
Iran Nuclear Deal	I served in the war in Iraq at the height of the war in 2005, a war that took over 4,000 of my brothers and sisters in uniforms’ lives.
Iran Nuclear Deal	The American people need to understand that this war with Iran would be far more devastating, far more costly than anything that we ever saw in Iraq.
Iran Nuclear Deal	It would take many more lives.
Iran Nuclear Deal	It would exacerbate the refugee crisis.
Iran Nuclear Deal	And it wouldn’t be just contained within Iran.
Iran Nuclear Deal	This would turn into a regional war.
Iran Nuclear Deal	This is why it’s so important that every one of us, every single American, stand up and say no war with Iran.
Iran Nuclear Deal	We need to get back into the Iran nuclear agreement, and we need to negotiate how we can improve it.
Iran Nuclear Deal	It was an imperfect deal.
Iran Nuclear Deal	There are issues, like their missile development, that needs to be addressed.
Iran Nuclear Deal	We can do both simultaneously to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and preventing us from going to war.
Iran Nuclear Deal	Your time is up.
Iran Nuclear Deal	And this is a very quick follow-up.
Iran Nuclear Deal	But what would your red line be that would — for military action against Iran?
Iran Nuclear Deal	Look, obviously, if there was an attack against the American — our troops, then there would have to be a response.
Iran Nuclear Deal	But my point is — and it’s important for us to recognize this — is Donald Trump and his cabinet, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and others — are creating a situation that just a spark would light off a war with Iran, which is incredibly dangerous.
Iran Nuclear Deal	That’s why we need to de-escalate tensions.
Iran Nuclear Deal	Trump needs to get back into the Iran nuclear deal and swallow his pride, put the American people first.
Iran Nuclear Deal	BLASIO: Hey, but wait a minute…
	
Supreme Court Nominees	I’m going to use 20 of my seconds just to say there’s one thing we don’t all agree with when it comes to guns, and I think it’s common sense, and over 70 percent of Americans agree with me.
Supreme Court Nominees	If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to buy and own a firearm.
Supreme Court Nominees	And not everybody in this field agrees with that.
Supreme Court Nominees	But in states like Connecticut that did that, they saw 40 percent drops in gun violence and 15 percent drops in suicides.
Supreme Court Nominees	We need to start having bold agendas on guns.
Supreme Court Nominees	When it comes to the Supreme Court, very clearly, we — I agree with my friend, Secretary Castro.
Supreme Court Nominees	We are going to get to 50 votes in the Senate.
Supreme Court Nominees	This is a team sport.
Supreme Court Nominees	Whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like South Carolina, because we can elect Jamie Harrison.
Supreme Court Nominees	They need to campaign in places like Iowa, because we can win a Senate seat there.
Supreme Court Nominees	This is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the Senate and more so that we cannot only balance the Supreme Court, but start to pass an aggressive agenda that, frankly, isn’t so aggressive, because most of America agrees with the policy objectives of our party.
Supreme Court Nominees	Mayor De Blasio…
Supreme Court Nominees	Rachel, we have to actually…
Supreme Court Nominees	Congressman Delaney, you’ll have some time in a moment on this issue.
Supreme Court Nominees	This issue is related…
Supreme Court Nominees	Congressman Delaney, I’ll give you some time in a moment.
Supreme Court Nominees	Mayor De Blasio, as an executive in the largest city in this country, you are used to saying what you want to have happen and having it happen.
Supreme Court Nominees	If you nominate a Supreme Court nominee as president of the United States and Mitch McConnell is still Senate majority leader, what makes you believe that he would allow you to make a nominee?
Supreme Court Nominees	BLASIO: Rachel, I am chief executive of the nation’s largest city, and I also wanted to just say something quick on the gun issue and come to your question.
Supreme Court Nominees	Look, I run the largest police force in America, too, and if we’re going to stop these shootings, we want to get these guns off the street, we have to have a very different relationship between our police and our community.
Supreme Court Nominees	I also want to say there’s something that sets me apart from all my colleagues running in this race, and that is, for the last 21 years, I have been raising a black son in America.
Supreme Court Nominees	And I have had to have very, very serious talks with my son, Dante, about how to protect himself on the streets of our city and all over this country, including how to deal with the fact that he has to take special caution because there have been too many tragedies between our young men and our police, too, as we saw recently in Indiana.
Supreme Court Nominees	So we need to have a different conversation in this country about guns, but also a different conversation about policing that brings policing community together.
Supreme Court Nominees	We’ve done that in New York City and we’ve driven down crime while we’ve done it.
Supreme Court Nominees	But to your question about Mitch McConnell, there is a political solution that we have to come to grips with.
Supreme Court Nominees	If the Democratic Party would stop acting like the party of the elites and be the party of working people again, and go into states, including red states, to convince people we’re on their side, we can put pressure on their senators to actually have to vote for the nominees that are put forward…
	
LGBTQ	Let me say that there is no one in our government at any level who has the right to tell any American who they should be allowed to love or who they should be allowed to marry.
LGBTQ	My record in Congress for over six years shows my commitment to fighting for LGBTQ equality.
LGBTQ	I serve on the Equality Caucus and recently voted for passage of the Equality Act.
LGBTQ	Maybe many people in this country can relate to the fact that I grew up in a socially conservative home, held views when I was very young that I no longer hold today.
LGBTQ	I’ve served with LGBTQ servicemembers, both in training and deployed downrange.
LGBTQ	I know that they would give their life for me and I would give my life for them.
LGBTQ	It is this commitment that I’ll carry through as president of the United States, recognizing that there are still people who are facing discrimination in the workplace, still people who are unable to find a home for their families.
LGBTQ	It is this kind of discrimination that we need to address.
LGBTQ	But it’s not enough.
LGBTQ	Thank you, Congresswoman Gabbard.
LGBTQ	It’s not enough.
LGBTQ	If I can add to this, it’s very important.
LGBTQ	Thirty seconds, Senator.
LGBTQ	It’s not enough.
LGBTQ	Look, civil rights is someplace to begin, but in the African American civil rights community, another place to focus on was to stop the lynching of African-Americans.
LGBTQ	We do not talk enough about trans Americans, especially African-American trans Americans… … and the incredibly high rates of murder right now.
LGBTQ	We don’t talk enough about how many children, about 30 percent of LGBTQ kids, who do not go to school because of fear.
LGBTQ	It’s not enough just to be on the Equality Act.
LGBTQ	I’m an original co-sponsor.
LGBTQ	We need to have a president that will fight to protect LGBTQ Americans every single day from violence in America.
LGBTQ	Senator Klobuchar, let me put this to you.
LGBTQ	On the issue of civil rights, for decades — on the civil rights and demographics, honestly, and politics, for decades, the Democratic Party has counted on African-American voter turnout as step one to winning elections on a national level.
LGBTQ	Democrats are counting on the Latino community now and in the future in the same way.
LGBTQ	What have you done for black and Latino voters that should enthuse them about going to the polls for you if you’re your party’s nominee?
LGBTQ	My life and my career and my work in the Senate has been about economic opportunity.
LGBTQ	And to me, this means better childcare for everyone in this country.
LGBTQ	And when you want an economy that works, you need to have retirement that works, you need to have public schools that work.
LGBTQ	And you also need to make sure that those communities are able to get those jobs of the future, the STEM jobs.
LGBTQ	In fact, Donald Trump, one of the first bills that he signed of the 34 he signed where I was the lead Democrat — OK, that’s a first up here — was one that was about that, making sure minority community members could share in those jobs.
LGBTQ	So to me, this is about a few things.
LGBTQ	It’s about an African-American woman that goes to a hospital in New Orleans, says her hands are swollen, and then doctor ignores her and her baby dies.
LGBTQ	It’s about the fact that African-American women make 61 cents for every dollar a white man makes.
LGBTQ	So in short, we need, one — and I will do this in my first 100 days as president — we will work to make sure everyone can vote at this table, everyone can vote in this country…
LGBTQ	That’s time, Senator.
LGBTQ	… and we will also go to the next step of criminal justice reform.
LGBTQ	Senator Booker and I worked on that First Step Act, but we should go to the second step act, which is to help all our communities across our country.
LGBTQ	Senator, thank you very much.
LGBTQ	Thirty-second follow-up to you, Secretary Castro.
LGBTQ	This is a 70 percent Latino city here in Miami.
LGBTQ	You are the only Latino Democrat who is running here this year in the presidential race.
LGBTQ	Is that enough of an answer, what Senator Klobuchar is describing there, an economic justice agenda?
LGBTQ	Is that enough to mobilize Latino voters to stand with the Democratic Party in a big way?
LGBTQ	Well, I also think that we have to recognize racial and social justice.
LGBTQ	And, you know, I was in Charleston not too long ago, and I remembered that Dylann Roof went to the Mother Emanuel AME church, and he murdered nine people who were worshipping, and then he was apprehended by police without incident.
LGBTQ	Well, but what about Eric Garner and Tamir Rice and Laquan McDonald and Sandra Bland and Pamela Turner and Antonio Arce?
LGBTQ	I’m proud that I’m the only candidate so far that has put forward legislation that would reform our policing system in America and make sure that no matter what the color of your skin is, that you’re treated the same, including Latinos who are mistreated too oftentimes by police.
	
Foreign Policy	John, appreciate the question.
Foreign Policy	The answer is yes, but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends.
Foreign Policy	When the United States presents a united front, we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer, the kind of genocide that we saw in Rwanda, the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward.
Foreign Policy	But unfortunately, under this administration, President Trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances.
Foreign Policy	He’s diminished our standing in the world and he’s made us weaker as a country, less able to confront challenges, whether it’s Iran or North Korea or Vladimir Putin in Russia, who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016, and who President Trump has offered another invitation to do the same.
Foreign Policy	He’s embraced strongmen and dictators at the expense of the great democracies.
Foreign Policy	As president, I will make sure that we live our values in our foreign policy.
Foreign Policy	I will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together.
Foreign Policy	That makes America stronger.
Foreign Policy	BLASIO: But what about the War Powers Act?
Foreign Policy	Congressman O’Rourke, thank you.
Foreign Policy	BLASIO: What about the War Powers Act being a part of that equation?
Foreign Policy	With deep respect to the congressman, look, we’ve learned painful lessons as Americans that we’ve gone to war without congressional authorization.
Foreign Policy	And look, this is very personal for me.
Foreign Policy	I know the cost of war.
Foreign Policy	My dad served in the Pacific in World War II in the U.S. Army, Battle of Okinawa, had half his leg blown off, and he came home with scars, both physical and emotional, and he did not recover.
Foreign Policy	He spiraled downward and he ultimately took his own life.
Foreign Policy	And that battle didn’t kill him, but that war did.
Foreign Policy	And, look, even in the humanitarian crisis — and I think we should be ready, Congressman, to intervene, God forbid there is genocide — but not without congressional approval.
Foreign Policy	Democrats and Republicans both in the Congress have not challenged presidents and have let them get away with running the military without that congressional approval.
Foreign Policy	We learned a lesson in Vietnam we seem to have forgotten, that decisions have to be made by the United States Congress…
Foreign Policy	I’m going to pick up — I want to pick up this point, and I want to put this to Congressman Ryan.
Foreign Policy	Today the Taliban claimed responsibility for killing two American servicemembers in Afghanistan.
Foreign Policy	Leaders as disparate as President Obama and President Trump have both said that they want to end U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, but it isn’t over for America.
Foreign Policy	Why isn’t it over?
Foreign Policy	Why can’t presidents of very different parties and very different temperaments get us out of there?
Foreign Policy	And how could you?
Foreign Policy	I appreciate that question.
Foreign Policy	So I’ve been in Congress 17 years.
Foreign Policy	And 12 of those years I’ve sat on the Armed Services Committee, the Defense Appropriations Committee or the Armed Services Committee.
Foreign Policy	And the lesson that I’ve learned over the years is that you have to stay engaged in these situations.
Foreign Policy	Nobody likes it.
Foreign Policy	It’s long.
Foreign Policy	It’s tedious.
Foreign Policy	But right now, we have — so I would say we must be engaged in this.
Foreign Policy	We must have our State Department engaged.
Foreign Policy	We must have our military engaged to the extent they need to be.
Foreign Policy	But the reality of it is, this president doesn’t even have people appointed in the State Department to deal with these things, whether we’re talking about Central America, whether we’re talking about Iran, whether we’re talking about Afghanistan.
Foreign Policy	We’ve got to be completely engaged.
Foreign Policy	And here’s why, because these flare-ups distract us from the real problems in the country.
Foreign Policy	If we’re getting drones shot down for $130 million, because the president is distracted, that’s $130 million that we could be spending in places like Youngstown, Ohio, or Flint, Michigan, or rebuilding — or rebuilding…
Foreign Policy	Congresswoman Gabbard, I’m going to give you 30 seconds, actually, to jump off what he said.
Foreign Policy	He described engagement as the problem.
Foreign Policy	Is that what you will tell — is that what you will tell the parents of those two soldiers who were just killed in Afghanistan?
Foreign Policy	Well, we just have to be engaged?
Foreign Policy	As a soldier, I will tell you, that answer is unacceptable.
Foreign Policy	We have to bring our troops home from Afghanistan.
Foreign Policy	We are in a place in Afghanistan where we have lost so many lives.
Foreign Policy	We’ve spent so much money.
Foreign Policy	Money that’s coming out of every one of our pockets, money that should be going into communities here at home, meeting the needs of the people here at home.
Foreign Policy	We are no better off in Afghanistan today than we were when this war began.
Foreign Policy	This is why it’s so important to have a president and commander-in-chief who knows the cost of war and who’s ready to do the job on day one.
Foreign Policy	I am ready to do that job when I walk into the Oval Office.
Foreign Policy	Listen, I’m going to go down the line — I’m going to go down — I’m going to go down — I’m going to go down the line here.
Foreign Policy	You know what, you felt — you felt like she was rebutting you.
Foreign Policy	Get 30 seconds, go.
Foreign Policy	Thank you.
Foreign Policy	You’re a very good man.
Foreign Policy	I appreciate that.
Foreign Policy	Fair enough.
Foreign Policy	I hear what you’re saying.
Foreign Policy	She invoked your name.
Foreign Policy	I would just say, I don’t want to be engaged.
Foreign Policy	I wish we were spending this money in places that I’ve represented that have been completely forgotten and we were rebuilding.
Foreign Policy	But the reality of it is, if the United States isn’t engaged, the Taliban will grow.
Foreign Policy	And they will have bigger, bolder terrorist acts.
Foreign Policy	We have got to have some presence there…
Foreign Policy	The Taliban was there long before we came in.
Foreign Policy	They’re going to be there long before we leave.
Foreign Policy	And they were — yeah, exactly.
Foreign Policy	Well, we were.
Foreign Policy	We cannot keep U.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan thinking that we’re going to somehow squash this Taliban that’s been there, that every other country that’s tried has failed.
Foreign Policy	I didn’t say — I didn’t say squash them.
Foreign Policy	I didn’t say squash them.
Foreign Policy	When we weren’t in there, they started flying planes into our buildings.
Foreign Policy	So I’m just saying right now … we have an obligation…
Foreign Policy	The Taliban didn’t attack us on 9/11.
Foreign Policy	Al Qaida did.
Foreign Policy	Well, I — I understand…
Foreign Policy	Al Qaida attacked us on 9/11.
Foreign Policy	That’s why I and so many other people joined the military, to go after Al Qaida, not the Taliban.
Foreign Policy	I understand that.
Foreign Policy	The Taliban…
Foreign Policy	Go ahead, Congressman.
Foreign Policy	Finish up, 10 seconds.
Foreign Policy	The Taliban was protecting those people who were plotting against us.
Foreign Policy	All I’m saying is, if we want to go into elections, and we want to say that we’ve got to withdraw from the world, that’s what President Trump is saying.
Foreign Policy	We can’t.
Foreign Policy	I would love for us to.
	
Opening statements	Well, you are quite right.
Opening statements	We have a new vision for America and at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America, while 500,000 people are sleeping out on the streets today we think it is time for change, real change.
Opening statements	And by that I mean that healthcare in my view is a human right and we have got to pass a Medicare for all single-payer system.
Opening statements	Under that system by the way vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now.
Opening statements	I believe that education is the future for this country and that is why I believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition-free and eliminate student debt and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street.
Opening statements	Every proposal that I have brought forth is fully paid for.
Opening statements	Senator Sanders I will give you 10 seconds just to ask the–answer the very direct question will you raise taxes for the middle class in a Sanders administration?
Opening statements	People who have healthcare under Medicare for all will have no premiums, no deductibles, no copayments, no out of expe–out-of-pocket expenses.
Opening statements	Yes, they will pay more in taxes but less in healthcare for what they get.
Opening statements	Thank you Senator.
Opening statements	Senator Sanders–
Opening statements	Senator–Senator Bennet we’re going to get to everybody.
	
Biden addresses income inequality	What I meant by that is look, Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America.
Biden addresses income inequality	Ordinary middle-class Americans built America.
Biden addresses income inequality	My dad used to have an expression he said Joe a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it’s about your dignity, it’s about respect, it’s being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything’s going to be okay.
Biden addresses income inequality	Too many people who are in the middle class and poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal.
Biden addresses income inequality	What I am saying is that we’ve got to be straightforward.
Biden addresses income inequality	We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it.
Biden addresses income inequality	They have to make sure that we (INAUDIBLE) situation where there’s continuing education and they are able to pay for it and they have to make sure that they are able to breathe air that is–is–is clean and they–they have water that they can drink.
Biden addresses income inequality	Look, Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation.
Biden addresses income inequality	We do have enormous income inequality and one thing I agree honestly can make massive cuts in the $1.6 trillion in tax loopholes out there and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy.
	
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Well, I think that the bottom line is, if we don’t clearly define that we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way they can and–and call us socialists.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	And if you look at the Green New Deal, which I admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change, I’m a scientist, but we can’t promise every American a government job if you want to get universal healthcare coverage.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	I believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege, but you can’t expect to eliminate private insurance for 180 million people, many of whom don’t want to give it up.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	In Colorado, we brought businesses and nonprofits together.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We got to near universal healthcare coverage.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We were the first state in America to–to bring the environmental community and the oil and gas industry to address, aggressively address methane emissions.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	And we were also the first place to–to expand reproductive rights on a scale basis that we reduced teen pregnancy by 54 percent.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We’ve done the big progressive things people said it couldn’t be done.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	I’ve done what pretty much everyone else up here is still talking about doing.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Governor, thank you.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Senator Sanders–I’ll give you a chance to–to weigh in here.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	What is your response to those who say nominating a–a socialist would reelect Donald Trump?
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Well, I think the responses at the polls, last poll I saw had us 10 points ahead of Donald Trump, because the American people understand that Trump is a phony, that Trump is a pathological liar and a racist, and then he lied to the American people during his campaign.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	He said he was going to stand up for working families.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Well, President Trump, you’re not standing up for working families when you try to throw 32 million people off the healthcare that they have and that 83 percent of your tax benefits go to the top 1 percent.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	That’s how we be Trump.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We expose him for the fraud that he is.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	In answer–
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Senator–
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–I want to talk about–
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Senator Gillibrand, 30 seconds.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	I disagree with both their perspectives.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	The debate we’re having in our party right now is confusing because the truth is there’s a big difference between capitalism on the one hand and greed on the other.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	And so, all the things that we’re trying to change is when companies care more about profits when they do about people.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	So, if you’re talking about ending gun violence, it’s the greed of the NRA and the gun manufacturers that make any progress impossible.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	It’s the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies when we want to try to get healthcare as a right and not a privilege.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Senator Gillibrand–
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–So, there may–
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Thank you–
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Not be disagreement in the party because, in truth, we want healthy capitalism.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Senator, thank you.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We don’t want corrupted capitalism–
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Thank you.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	I want to be fair to all the candidates–
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Which is the definition of greed.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Thank you.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Senator Bennet–You have said, “It’s possible to write policy proposals that have no basis in reality.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	You might as well call them candy.” Were you referring to any candidate or proposal in particular when you said that?
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Are you–was that directed to me?
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Yes, that was your quote.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Well, thank you.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	That sounded like me.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Thank you.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	It was you.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	I appreciate it.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Well–
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–It definitely wasn’t me–
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Look, first of all, I agree completely with Bernie about what the fundamental challenge we’re facing as a country is, 40 years of no economic growth for 90 percent of the American people.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	One hundred and sixty thousand families in the top .1 percent have the same wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and we got the worst income inequality that we’ve had in 100 years.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Where I disagree is on his solution on Medicare for All.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	You know, I–I have proposed getting to universal healthcare, which we need to do.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	It is a right.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Healthcare is a right.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We need to get to personal healthcare.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	I believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with Obamacare and creating a public option that every family and every person in America can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option which for them would be like having Medicare for all or whether they want to keep their private insurance.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	I believe we will get there much more quickly if we do that.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	If I could just finish–Bernie mentioned that the taxes that we would have to pay because of those taxes Vermont rejected Medicare for all.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	In Bernie’s bill, in Bernie’s bill I wrote–
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We are going to talk about healthcare at length Senator, but at the moment my colleague–
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	In Senator Sanders’ bill I wrote the part in Senator Sanders’ bill that is the transition that merges what the two senators said.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Senator.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	The truth is if you have a buy in over a four or five year period you move us to single payer more quickly.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	BALART: Senator, we will get to this.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We will get to this.
	
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	I got $100,000 in student loan debt myself.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	I tell you–if I count on the people who have been in government for the past 30 years who were around when this problem was created to be the ones to solve it it is going to be the next generation, the 40 million of us who can’t start a family.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Can’t take a good idea and start a business and can’t buy our first home.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	This is the generation that’s going to be able to solve student loan debt.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	This generation is ready to lead.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	BALART: Mr.–Mr. Yang your signature policy is to give every adult in the United States $1,000 a month no questions asked.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	That’s right.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	BALART: I think that’s like $3.2 trillion a–a year.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	How would you do that?
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	I’m sorry?
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	BALART: Oh, so it’s difficult to do if you have companies like Amazon, trillion dollar tech companies paying literally 0 in taxes while they’re closing 30 percent of our stores.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Now, we need to put the American people in a position to benefit from all of these innovations in other parts of the economy.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	And if we had a value added tax at even half the European level it would generate over 800 billion in new revenue which combined with the money in our hands it would be the trickle up economy from our people, families and communities up we would spend the money and circulate through our regional economies and neighborhoods–creating millions of jobs, making our families stronger and healthier.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	We’d save money on things like incarceration, homelessness services, emergency room healthcare and just the value gains from having a stronger, healthier, mentally healthier population would increase GDP by $700 billion.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	This is the move we have to make particularly as technology is now automating away millions of American’s jobs, why Donald Trump is our president today that we automated away 400 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and we’re about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs, call center jobs, fast food jobs, truck driving jobs on and on throughout the economy.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	BALART: So, I get to understand you a little better.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	So, you’re saying $1,000 a month for everyone over 18 but a value added tax so you can spend that $1000 on value added tax?
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Well, the value added tax what it would end up–you would still be increasing the buying power of the bottom 94 percent of Americans.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	You have to spend a lot of money for a mild value add tax to eat up $12,000 a year per individual.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	So for the average family with two or three adults it would $24 to $36,000 a year.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	BALART: OK.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	So, Congressman Swalwell, want to talk a little bit about what Mr. Yang is talking about and you just actually mentioned it–many Americans are worried about things like self-driving cars, robots, drones, artificial intelligence will cost them their jobs.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	What would you to help people get the skills they need to adapt to this new world?
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	We must always be a country where technology creates more jobs than–
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	–Displaces.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	And I’ve seen the anxiety across America where the manufacturing floors go from 1,000 to 100 to one.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	So, we have to modernize our schools, value the teachers who prepare our kids, wipe the student debt from any teacher that goes into a community that needs it.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Invest in America’s communities, especially where places where the best exports are people who move away to get skills.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	But, Jose, I was six years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic Convention and said, it’s time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	That candidate was then Senator Joe Biden.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Joe Biden was right when he said it was time the pass the torch to a new generation of Americans 32 years ago.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	He’s still right today.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	If we’re going to solve the issues of automation (PH), pass the torch.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	If we’re going to solve the issues of climate chaos, pass the torch.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	If we’re going to solve the issue of student loan debt, pass the torch.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	If we’re going to end gun violence for families who are fearful of sending their kids to school, pass the torch.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Vice president, would you like to sing a torch song?
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	I would.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	I’m still holding on to that torch.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	I want to make it clear to you, look, the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on to educate for an education.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	The fact is that that’s why I propose us focusing on schools that are in distress.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	That’s why I think we should triple the amount of money we spend for Title I schools.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	That’s why I think we should have universal Pre-K.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	That’s why I think every single person who graduates from high school–65 out of 100 now need something beyond high school and we should provide for them to be able to get that education.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	That’s why there should be free community college, cutting in half the cost of college.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	That’s why we should be in the position where we do not have anyone have to pay back the student debt when they get out, they’re making less than $25,000 a year.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Their debt is frozen.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	No interest payment until they get beyond that.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	We can’t put people in a position where they aren’t able to go on and move on.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	And so, folks, there’s a lot we can do, but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the 21st century.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	We’re not doing that now.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Senator.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Senator.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	As the youngest–as the youngest guy on the stage, I feel like I probably ought to contribute to the generation.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Before–before–
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	As part of Joe’s generation–
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	–I’m for–
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	–I’m all for–

Sen. Harris’ ‘food fight’ moment	My great economy.
Sen. Harris’ ‘food fight’ moment	You ask him, well, how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours and he talks about the stock market.
Sen. Harris’ ‘food fight’ moment	Well, that’s fine if you own stocks.
Sen. Harris’ ‘food fight’ moment	So many families in America do not.
Sen. Harris’ ‘food fight’ moment	You ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers.
Sen. Harris’ ‘food fight’ moment	Well, yeah, people in America are working.
Sen. Harris’ ‘food fight’ moment	They’re working two and three jobs.
Sen. Harris’ ‘food fight’ moment	So, when we talk about jobs, let’s be very clear.
Sen. Harris’ ‘food fight’ moment	In our America, no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table.

Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	Well, I just want to agree that I think Russia is our biggest geopolitical threat because they’ve been hacking our democracy successfully.
Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	They’ve been laughing their asses off about it for the last couple of years and we should focus on that before we start worrying about other threats.

Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	We’ve got a much bigger issue on our hands.
Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	But in a moment when their authoritarian model is being held up as an alternative to ours because ours looks so chaotic compared to theirs right now because of our internal divisions.
Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	The biggest thing we’ve got to do is invest in our own domestic competitiveness.

Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	–In our own infrastructure, education we are never gonna be able to compete.

Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	And when I look into his mother’s eyes I have to face the fact and nothing that I say will bring him back.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	This is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	And until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism whatever this particular incident teaches us we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that there is a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	Not just from what has happened in the past but what’s happening around the country in the present.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	It threatens the well being of every community.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	And I am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle when they see a police officer approaching feels the exact same thing.

Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	Mayor Buttigieg, Mayor Buttigieg, if I could ask one question because I think–
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	Governor, I’ll give you 30 seconds.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	I think that the question they are asking in South Bend I think across the country is why is it taking so long?

Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	Governor Hickenlooper, thank you.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	We–
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	I’ve got to respond to that.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	Look, we’ve taken so many steps toward police accountability that the FOP just denounced me for too much accountability.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	We’re obviously not there yet.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	And I accept responsibility for that–
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	(INAUDIBLE) you should fire the chief.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	So, under Indiana law this will be investigated.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	And there will be accountability for the officer involved.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	But you’re the mayor.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	You should fire the chief if that’s the policy and someone died.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	All of these issues are extremely important but there are specifics, there are symptoms.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	And the underlying cause has to do with deep, deep, deep realms of racial injustice.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	Both in our criminal justice system and in our economic system.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	And the democratic party should be on the side of reparations for slavery for this very reason.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	I do not believe–I do not believe that the average American is a racist.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	But the average American is woefully undereducated about the history of race in the United States.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	Vice President Biden, we’re going to get to you.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	Hang on.
Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	We’re going to get–

Candidates comment on diversity	No, absolutely not.
Candidates comment on diversity	Unlike the Republican party we encourage diverse city, we believe in diverse city, that is what America is up about.
Candidates comment on diversity	But in addition to diversity in terms of having more women, more people from the GB–L–LGBT community we also have to do something else and that is we have to ask ourselves a simple question and that how come to day the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1 percent has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth.
Candidates comment on diversity	We need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interest who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.
Candidates comment on diversity	Senator Gillibrand I want to give you 30 seconds on this.
Candidates comment on diversity	Well, first of all where Bernie left off we have heard a lot of good ideas on this stage tonight and a lot of plans but the truth is until you go to the root of the corruption, the money in the–in politics, the fact that Washington is run by these special interest you are never going to solve any of these problems.
Candidates comment on diversity	I have the most comprehensive approach that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption to get money out of politics through publicly funded elections, to have clean elections.
Candidates comment on diversity	If we do that and get money out of politics we can guarantee healthcare as a right not a privilege we can deal with institutional racism, we can’t take on income inequality and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs Washington.
	
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Gridlock will not magically disappear as long as Mitch McConnell is there, first.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Second, second, that is why it is so important for us to when not just the presidency to have somebody that can run in all 50 states but to–but to win the Senate as well and that is why we have to propose policies that can be supported like Medicare X (PH) so that we can build a broad coalition of Americans to overcome broken Washington DC.

Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Vice President Biden–
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Can I respond–
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Thirty seconds.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	I want–I–what–it does sound as if you haven’t seen what’s been happening in the United States Senate over the last 12 years.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	It didn’t happen.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Why?
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	I have seen what happened just sense we were vice president.

Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	But sometimes you can’t do that.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Sometimes you just have to go out and beat them.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	I went into 20 states, over 60 candidates–
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Okay, thank you–
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–And guess what?

Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	The Democratic Party had been running against that for 10 years.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	We’ve lost that economic argument because that deal extended almost all those Bush tax cuts permanently and put in place the mindless cuts that we still are dealing with today that are called the sequester.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	That was a great deal for Mitch McConnell.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Oh, come on.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	It was a terrible deal for America.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Thank you.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Thank you, Senator Bennet.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	And you heard from Republicans.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Right, right.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	You heard from the Republicans–
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Go ahead, 30 seconds–
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–That the reason why the Trump tax cut had to be passed is because they had to pay back their donors.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	You heard it.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	They actually said those words.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	So, the corruption in Washington is real, and it is something that makes every one of the plans we’ve heard about over the last several months impossible.

Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Go ahead.
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Senator Gillibrand, I’m trying–
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–And you can–and as president–
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–To get everyone in here–
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–It’s the first thing I’m going–
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Thank you–
Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–To do because nothing else is possible, whether it’s education or healthcare or ending institutional racism.
	
Candidates on abortion rights	Well, my plan is somebody who believes, for a start, that a woman’s right to control her own body is a constitutional right, that government and politicians should not infringe on that right.
Candidates on abortion rights	We will do everything we can to defense our–Roe versus Wade.
Candidates on abortion rights	Second of all, let me make– –Let me make–let me make a promise here.
Candidates on abortion rights	You asked about litmus test.
Candidates on abortion rights	My litmus test is I will never appoint any–nominate any justice to the Supreme Court unless that justice is 100 percent clear he or she will defend Roe v.
Candidates on abortion rights	Wade.
Candidates on abortion rights	Third of all, I do not believe in packing the court.
Candidates on abortion rights	right now.
Candidates on abortion rights	But I do believe that constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts.
Candidates on abortion rights	And that brings in new blood into the supreme court and a majority I hope that will understand that a woman has the right to control her own body and that corporations cannot run the United States of America.
Candidates on abortion rights	Senator
Candidates on abortion rights	I’m going to give you 10 additional seconds because (INAUDIBLE) what if the court has already overturned Roe and Roe is gone?
Candidates on abortion rights	All of the things you have described would be to try to preserve Roe.
Candidates on abortion rights	If Roe was gone what could you do as president to preserve abortion rights?
Candidates on abortion rights	Well, first of all let me tell you this–didn’t come up yet but let’s face this–Medicare for All guarantees every woman in this country the right to have an abortion if she wants it.
Candidates on abortion rights	Thank you, Senator.
Candidates on abortion rights	And can I just address this for a second?
Candidates on abortion rights	And I–and I want to talk directly-directly to America’s women and to men who love them–women’s reproductive rights are under assault by President Trump and the Republican party.
Candidates on abortion rights	Thirty states are trying to overturn Roe v.
Candidates on abortion rights	Wade right now.
Candidates on abortion rights	And it is mind boggling to me that we are debating this on this stage in 2019 among democrats whether women should have access to reproductive rights.
Candidates on abortion rights	I think we have to stop playing defense and start playing offense.
Candidates on abortion rights	But let me tell you one thing about politics because it goes to the corruption of the deal making–when the door is closed negotiations are made.
Candidates on abortion rights	There are conversations about women’s rights and compromises have been made behind our backs.
Candidates on abortion rights	That’s how we got to Hyde.
Candidates on abortion rights	That’s how the Hyde Amendment was created.
Candidates on abortion rights	A compromise by leaders of both parties.
Candidates on abortion rights	Then we have the ACA.
Candidates on abortion rights	During the ACA neg–negotiations I had to fight like heck with other women to make sure that contraception wasn’t sold down the river or abortion services.
Candidates on abortion rights	And so, what we need to know is imagine this one question–when we beat President Trump and Mitch McConnell walks into the Oval Office god forbid to do negotiations who do you want when that door closes to be sitting behind that desk to fight for women’s rights?
Candidates on abortion rights	I have been the fiercest advocate for women’s reproductive freedom for over a decade.
Candidates on abortion rights	Thank you.
Candidates on abortion rights	And I promise you as President–
Candidates on abortion rights	Senator–
Candidates on abortion rights	–when that door closes I will guarantee women’s reproductive (INAUDIBLE) no matter what.
	
Candidates on climate	Well, first of all I don’t even call it climate change.
Candidates on climate	It’s a climate crisis.
Candidates on climate	It represents an existential threat to us as a species.
Candidates on climate	And the fact that we have a President of the United States who has embraced science fiction over science fact will be to our collective peril.
Candidates on climate	I visited while the embers were smoldering the wildfires in California I spoke with firefighters who were in the midst of fighting a fire while their own homes were burning.
Candidates on climate	And on this issue it is a–it is a critical issue that is about what we must do to confront what is immediate and before us right now.
Candidates on climate	That is why I support a Green New Deal.
Candidates on climate	It is why I believe on day one and as President will re-enter us in the Paris agreement because we have to take these issues seriously and frankly, we have a President of the United States we talked about you asked before what is the greatest national security threat to the United States?
Candidates on climate	It’s Donald Trump.
Candidates on climate	And I’m going to tell you why.
Candidates on climate	And I’m going to tell you why because I agree climate change represents an existential threat.
Candidates on climate	He denies the science.
Candidates on climate	You want to talk about North Korea, real threat in terms of nuclear arsenal but what doe she do?
Candidates on climate	He embraces Kim Jong Un a dictator
Candidates on climate	History where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people.
Candidates on climate	I have supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran for (INAUDIBLE).
Candidates on climate	Vice President Biden 30 seconds because I want to bring other people into this.
Candidates on climate	I–I supported the ERA from the very beginning.
Candidates on climate	I am the guy that extended the voting rights act for 25 years.
Candidates on climate	We got to the place where we got 98 out of 98 votes in the United States Senate doing it.
Candidates on climate	I have also argued very strongly that we in fact deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box.
Candidates on climate	I agree that everybody once they in fact–my time is up.
Candidates on climate	I’m sorry.
Candidates on climate	Thank you vice president.
Candidates on climate	All of these things (INAUDIBLE).
Candidates on climate	Senator Sanders–Senator Sanders, I want to go to you on this.
Candidates on climate	You said on the day you launched your campaign that voters should focus on what people stand for, not a candidate’s race or age or sexual orientation.
Candidates on climate	Any Democrats are very excited by the diversity of this field on this stage and on last night stage and the perspective that diverse city brings to this contest and to these issues.
Candidates on climate	Are you telling Democratic voters that diverse city should it matter when they make this decision?
Candidates on climate	No, absolutely not.
Candidates on climate	Unlike the Republican party we encourage diverse city, we believe in diverse city, that is what America is up about.
Candidates on climate	But in addition to diversity in terms of having more women, more people from the GB–L–LGBT community we also have to do something else and that is we have to ask ourselves a simple question and that how come to day the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1 percent has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth.

On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	Gridlock will not magically disappear as long as Mitch McConnell is there, first.
On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	Second, second, that is why it is so important for us to when not just the presidency to have somebody that can run in all 50 states but to–but to win the Senate as well and that is why we have to propose policies that can be supported like Medicare X so that we can build a broad coalition of Americans to overcome broken Washington DC.
