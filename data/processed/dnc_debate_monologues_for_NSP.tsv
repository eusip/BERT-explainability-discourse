Economy	So I think of it this way.
Economy	Who is this economy really working for?
Economy	It’s doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top.
Economy	It’s doing great for giant drug companies.
Economy	It’s just not doing great for people who are trying to get a prescription filled.
Economy	It’s doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons, just not for the African-Americans and Latinos whose families are torn apart, whose lives are destroyed, and whose communities are ruined.
Economy	It’s doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us.
Economy	When you’ve got a government, when you’ve got an economy that does great for those with money and isn’t doing great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple.
Economy	We need to call it out.
Economy	We need to attack it head on.
Economy	And we need to make structural change in our government, in our economy, and in our country.
	
Guns	So, in this period of time that I have been running for president, I’ve had more than 100 town halls.
Guns	I’ve taken more than 2,000 unfiltered questions.
Guns	And the single hardest questions I’ve gotten, I got one from a little boy and I got one from a little girl, and that is to say, when you’re president, how are you going to keep us safe?
Guns	That’s our responsibility as adults.
Guns	Seven children will die today from gun violence, children and teenagers.
Guns	And they won’t just die in mass shootings.
Guns	They’ll die on sidewalks, they’ll die in playgrounds, they’ll die in people’s backyards.
Guns	Gun violence is a national health emergency in this country.
Guns	And we need to treat it like that.
Guns	So what can we do?
Guns	We can do the things that are sensible.
Guns	We can do the universal background checks.
Guns	We can ban the weapons of war.
Guns	But we can also double down on the research and find out what really works, where it is that we can make the differences at the margins that will keep our children safe.
Guns	We need to treat this like the virus that’s killing our children.
	
Mitch McConnell	I do.
Mitch McConnell	We are democracy.
Mitch McConnell	And the way a democracy is supposed to work is the will of the people matters.
Mitch McConnell	Now, we have for far too long have had a Congress in Washington that has just completely dismissed what people care about across this country.
Mitch McConnell	They have made this country work much better than for those who can make giant contributions, made it work better for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers, and not made it work for the people.
Mitch McConnell	Well, here’s how I see this happening.
Mitch McConnell	Number one, sure, I want to see us get a Democratic majority in the Senate.
Mitch McConnell	But short of a Democratic majority in the Senate, you better understand the fight still goes on.
Mitch McConnell	It starts in the White House, and it means that everybody we energize in 2020 stays on the frontlines come January 2021.
Mitch McConnell	We have to push from the outside, have leadership from the inside, and make this Congress reflect the will of the people.
	
Climate Change	Yes, first by taking away the filibuster from Mitch McConnell, to start with.
Climate Change	We have to do that.
Climate Change	Look it, look it, we are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change, and we are the last that can do something it.
Climate Change	Our towns are burning.
Climate Change	Our fields are flooding.
Climate Change	Miami is inundated.
Climate Change	And we have to understand, this is a climate crisis, an emergency (OFF-MIKE) this is our last chance in the administration, next one, to do something about it.
Climate Change	And we need to do what I’ve done in my state.
Climate Change	We’ve passed a 100 percent clean electrical grid bill.
Climate Change	We now have a vision statement.
Climate Change	And my plan has been called the gold standard of putting people to work.
Climate Change	But the most important thing on this, in the biggest decision for the American public is, who is going to make this the first priority?
Climate Change	And I am the candidate and the only one who’s saying this has to be the top priority of the United States, the organizing principle to mobilize the United States, so that we can do what we’ve always done, lead the world and invent the future and put 8 million people to work.
Climate Change	That’s what we’re going to do.
	
Impeachment	One of the most powerful pieces of art in the United States Capitol is the Trumbull painting of General George Washington resigning his commission to the Continental Congress, at the height of his power, submitting to the rule of law and the will of people.
Impeachment	That has withstood the test of time for the last 243 years.
Impeachment	If we set another precedent now that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power, a president who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy, if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity, then we will have set a new standard, and that is that some people, because of the position of power and public trust that they hold, are above the law.
Impeachment	And we cannot allow that to stand.
Impeachment	So we must begin impeachment now so that we have the facts and the truth and we follow them as far as they go and as high up as they reach and we save this democracy.
Impeachment	And if we’ve not been able to do that in this year or the year that follows, and under my administration, our Department of Justice will pursue these facts and ensure that there are consequences, there is accountability, and there is justice.
Impeachment	It’s the only way that we save this country.
	
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	Sure.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	So, college affordability is personal for us.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	Chasten and I have six figure student debt.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	I believe in reducing student debt.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	It’s logical to me that if you can refinance your house you ought to be able to refinance your student debt.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	I also believe in free college for low and middle income students for whom cost could be a barrier.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	I just don’t believe it makes sense to ask working class families to subsidize even the children of billionaires.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	I think the children of the wealthiest Americans can pay at least a little bit of tuition.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	And while I want — want tuition costs to go down I don’t think we can buy down every last penny for that.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	Now, there’s something else that doesn’t get talked about in the college affordability debate.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	Yes, it needs to be more affordable in this country to go to college.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	It also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	You should be able to live well, afford rent, be generous to your children– (INAUDIBLE) little league whether you went to college or not.
Buttigieg on why he doesn’t support free college	That’s one of many reasons we need to raise the minimum wage to at least $15.00 an hour.
	
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	So, this is a very important issue.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	So, the plan that Senator Sanders and I and other support Medicare for All is how you get to single payer, but it has a buy in transition period, which is really important.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	In 2005 when I ran for Congress in a two to one republican district, I actually ran on Medicare for All and I won that two to one republican district twice.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And the way I formulated it was simple.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Anyone who doesn’t have access to insurance they like, they could buy it in a percentage of income they could afford.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	So, that’s what we put into the transition period for our Medicare for All Plan.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I believe we need to get to universal healthcare as a right, not a privilege to single payer.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	The quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	God bless the insurers if they want to compete, they can certainly try.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	But, they’d never put people over their profits and I doubt they ever will.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	So, what will happen is people will choose Medicare.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	You will transition.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We would get to Medicare for All.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And then your step to single payer is so short.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I would make it an earned benefit just like Social Security, so that you buy in your whole life.
Candidates weigh in on healthcare	It is always there for you and it’s permanent and it’s universal.
	
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Immediately on January 20th of 2021 I will first of all we cannot forget our DACA recipients so I’m going to start there.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I will immediately by executive action reinstate DACA status and DACA protection to those young people.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I will further extend protection for deferral of deportation for their parents and for veterans who we have so many who are undocumented and who have served our country and fought for our democracy.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I will also immediately put in place immediate process for reviewing the cases for asylum.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I will release children from cages.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I will get rid of the private detention centers.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And I will ensure that the–this microphone that the President of the United States holds in her hand is use din a way that is about reflecting the values of our country and not about locking children up, separating them from their parents.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	And I have to just say that we have to think about this issue in terms of real people.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	A mother who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin, through the entire country of Mexico facing unknown peril to come here why would that mother do that?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	I will tell you.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	But what does Donald Trump do?
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	He says go back to where you came from.
Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	That is not reflective of our America and our values and it has got to end.
	
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Okay.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	So, on the issue of race, I couldn’t agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I–there is not a black man I know, be he a relative, a friend or a coworker who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	Growing up, my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn’t play with us because she–because we were black.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	And I will say also that–that in this campaign, we’ve also heard–and I’m going to now direct this to Vice President Biden.
Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	I do not believe you are a racist and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.
	
Klobuchar's rivals programs	Well, first, the economy.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	And Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what’s going on, when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	So I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	I do.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	But I think my plan is a good one.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	And my plan would be to, first of all, make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	My own dad and my sister got their first degrees with community college.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	There’s many paths to success, as well as certifications.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	Secondly, I’d used Pell grants.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	I’d double them from $6,000 to $12,000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered, to families that make up to $100,000.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	And then the third thing I would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans.
Klobuchar's rivals programs	Because I can tell you this: If billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.
	
Top tax rate	This economy has got to work for everyone.
Top tax rate	And right now, we know that it isn’t.
Top tax rate	And it’s going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does.
Top tax rate	(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Right now, we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes.
Top tax rate	That’s how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest.
Top tax rate	A $2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality.
Top tax rate	A new democracy that is revived because we’ve returned power to the people, no PACs, no gerrymandering, automatic and same-day voter registration to bring in more voters, and a new Voting Rights Act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now…
	
breaking up of tech companies	I don’t think I disagree.
breaking up of tech companies	I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation.
breaking up of tech companies	And you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from labor, and we have people that work full-time jobs and still can’t make a living wage.
breaking up of tech companies	We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs.
breaking up of tech companies	And you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that’s hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete.
breaking up of tech companies	One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector.
breaking up of tech companies	So I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work.
breaking up of tech companies	And I’ll tell you this.
breaking up of tech companies	I live in a low-income black and brown community.
breaking up of tech companies	I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans.
breaking up of tech companies	The indicators that are being used, from GDP to Wall Street’s rankings, is not helping people in my community.
breaking up of tech companies	It is about time that we have an economy that works for everybody, not just the wealthiest in our nation.
	
Gender Pay gap	Thank you very much for that question, Lester.
Gender Pay gap	You know, I grew up with a mother who raised my brother, Joaquin, and me as a single parent.
Gender Pay gap	And I know what it’s like to struggle.
Gender Pay gap	I know what it’s like to rent a home and to worry about whether you’re going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month and to see a mom work very, very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because they’re women.
Gender Pay gap	I would do several things, starting with something we should have done a long time ago, which is to pass the Equal Rights Amendment finally in this country.
Gender Pay gap	And also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country.
Gender Pay gap	It’s past time that we did that.
Gender Pay gap	And, you know, we have to do this.
Gender Pay gap	If we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century, we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve.
	
Income Inequality	Well, we’ve been addressing income inequality in New York City by raising wages, by raising benefits, by putting money back in the hands of working people, $15 minimum wage, paid sick days, pre-K for all, things that are making a huge difference in working people’s lives.
Income Inequality	But let me tell you, what we’re hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle for the heart and soul of our party.
Income Inequality	I want to make it clear.
Income Inequality	This is supposed to be the party of working people.
Income Inequality	Yes, we’re supposed to be for a 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy.
Income Inequality	Yes, we’re supposed to be for free college, free public college, for our young people.
Income Inequality	We are supposed to break up big corporations when they’re not serving our democracy.
Income Inequality	This Democratic Party has to be strong and bold and progressive.
Income Inequality	And in New York, we’ve proven that we can do something very different, we can put money back in the hands of working people.
Income Inequality	And let me tell you, every time you talk about investing in people and their communities, you hear folks say there’s not enough money.
Income Inequality	What I say to them every single time is, there’s plenty of money in this world, there’s plenty of money in this country.
Income Inequality	It’s just in the wrong hands.
Income Inequality	Democrats have to fix that.
Income Inequality	(APPLAUSE)
	
Manufacturing Jobs	Yes, I believe you can, but, first, let’s say the president came, he said don’t sell your house to people in Youngstown, Ohio.
Manufacturing Jobs	And then his administration just in the last two years, we lost $4,000 — 4,000 jobs at a General Motors facility.
Manufacturing Jobs	That rippled throughout our community.
Manufacturing Jobs	General Motors got a tax cut.
Manufacturing Jobs	General Motors got a bailout.
Manufacturing Jobs	And then they have the audacity to move a new car that they’re going to produce to Mexico.
Manufacturing Jobs	I’ve had family members that have to unbolt a machine from the factory floor, put it in a box, and ship it to China.
Manufacturing Jobs	My area where I come from in northeast Ohio, this issue we’re talking about here, it’s been going on 40 years.
Manufacturing Jobs	This is not a new phenomenon in the United States of America.
Manufacturing Jobs	The bottom 60 percent haven’t seen a raise since 1980.
Manufacturing Jobs	Meanwhile, the top 1 percent control 90 percent of the wealth.
Manufacturing Jobs	We need an industrial policy saying we’re going to dominate building electric vehicles, there’s going to be 30 million made in the next 10 years.
Manufacturing Jobs	I want half of them made in the United States.
Manufacturing Jobs	I want to dominate the solar industry…
	
Healthcare	Well, I think it’s a bold approach.
Healthcare	It’s something that Barack Obama wanted to do when we were working on the Affordable Care Act.
Healthcare	And that is a public option.
Healthcare	I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in four years, which is exactly what this bill says.
Healthcare	So let me go on beyond that.
Healthcare	There is a much bigger issue in addition to that, and that is pharmaceuticals.
Healthcare	The president literally went on TV, on Fox, and said that people’s heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices.
Healthcare	Instead, 2,500 drugs have gone up in double-digits since he came into office.
Healthcare	Instead, he gave $100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies.
Healthcare	For the rest of us, for the rest of America, that’s what we call at home all foam and no beer.
Healthcare	We got nothing out of it.
Healthcare	And so my proposal is to do something about pharma, to take them on, to allow negotiation under Medicare, to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries.
Healthcare	And pharma thinks they own Washington?
Healthcare	Well, they don’t own me.
	
Abortion	It should not be an option in the United States of America for any insurance company to deny a woman coverage for their exercise of their right of choice.
Abortion	And I am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a woman’s right of reproductive health in health insurance, and I’m the only candidate who has passed a public option.
Abortion	And I respect everybody’s goals and plans here, but we do have one candidate that’s actually advanced the ball.
Abortion	And we’ve got to have access for everyone.
Abortion	I’ve done it as a public option.
	
Opiod Crisis	They should absolutely be held criminally liable, because they are liable and responsible.
Opiod Crisis	This is one of the reasons why well before I was running for president I said I would not take contributions from pharma companies, not take contributions from corporate PACs, or pharma executives, because they are part of this problem.
Opiod Crisis	And this opioid addiction in our country, we in cities like mine have been seeing how we’ve tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long.
Opiod Crisis	It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that.
	
Undocumented Immigrants	Thank you very much, Jose.
Undocumented Immigrants	I’m very proud that in April I became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan.
Undocumented Immigrants	And we saw those images… … watching that image of Oscar and his daughter, Valeria, is heartbreaking.
Undocumented Immigrants	It should also piss us all off.
Undocumented Immigrants	If I were president today — and it should spur us to action.
Undocumented Immigrants	If I were president today, I would sign an executive order that would get rid of Trump’s zero-tolerance policy, the remain in Mexico policy, and the metering policy — this metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river.
Undocumented Immigrants	They had been playing games with people who are coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry.
Undocumented Immigrants	Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry, and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim, so they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river, and they died because of that.
	
Iran Nuclear Deal	May I address that?
Iran Nuclear Deal	First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal.
Iran Nuclear Deal	And one of the reasons why we’re seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation.
Iran Nuclear Deal	Literally, he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years.
Iran Nuclear Deal	And now we see Iran threatening to go further and who are pulled — being pulled further and further into this crisis.
Iran Nuclear Deal	We need to renegotiate and get back into a deal, but I’m not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally I’m going to rejoin that deal.
Iran Nuclear Deal	Because when I’m president of the United States, I’m going to do the best I can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if I have an opportunity to leverage a better deal, I’m going to do it.
	
Supreme Court Nominees	I’m going to use 20 of my seconds just to say there’s one thing we don’t all agree with when it comes to guns, and I think it’s common sense, and over 70 percent of Americans agree with me.
Supreme Court Nominees	If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to buy and own a firearm.
Supreme Court Nominees	And not everybody in this field agrees with that.
Supreme Court Nominees	But in states like Connecticut that did that, they saw 40 percent drops in gun violence and 15 percent drops in suicides.
Supreme Court Nominees	We need to start having bold agendas on guns.
Supreme Court Nominees	When it comes to the Supreme Court, very clearly, we — I agree with my friend, Secretary Castro.
Supreme Court Nominees	We are going to get to 50 votes in the Senate.
Supreme Court Nominees	This is a team sport.
Supreme Court Nominees	Whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like South Carolina, because we can elect Jamie Harrison.
Supreme Court Nominees	They need to campaign in places like Iowa, because we can win a Senate seat there.
Supreme Court Nominees	This is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the Senate and more so that we cannot only balance the Supreme Court, but start to pass an aggressive agenda that, frankly, isn’t so aggressive, because most of America agrees with the policy objectives of our party.
	
LGBTQ	Let me say that there is no one in our government at any level who has the right to tell any American who they should be allowed to love or who they should be allowed to marry.
LGBTQ	My record in Congress for over six years shows my commitment to fighting for LGBTQ equality.
LGBTQ	I serve on the Equality Caucus and recently voted for passage of the Equality Act.
LGBTQ	Maybe many people in this country can relate to the fact that I grew up in a socially conservative home, held views when I was very young that I no longer hold today.
LGBTQ	I’ve served with LGBTQ servicemembers, both in training and deployed downrange.
LGBTQ	I know that they would give their life for me and I would give my life for them.
LGBTQ	It is this commitment that I’ll carry through as president of the United States, recognizing that there are still people who are facing discrimination in the workplace, still people who are unable to find a home for their families.
LGBTQ	It is this kind of discrimination that we need to address.
	
Foreign Policy	John, appreciate the question.
Foreign Policy	The answer is yes, but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends.
Foreign Policy	When the United States presents a united front, we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer, the kind of genocide that we saw in Rwanda, the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward.
Foreign Policy	But unfortunately, under this administration, President Trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances.
Foreign Policy	He’s diminished our standing in the world and he’s made us weaker as a country, less able to confront challenges, whether it’s Iran or North Korea or Vladimir Putin in Russia, who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016, and who President Trump has offered another invitation to do the same.
Foreign Policy	He’s embraced strongmen and dictators at the expense of the great democracies.
Foreign Policy	As president, I will make sure that we live our values in our foreign policy.
Foreign Policy	I will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together.
Foreign Policy	That makes America stronger.
	
Opening statements	Well, you are quite right.
Opening statements	We have a new vision for America and at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America, while 500,000 people are sleeping out on the streets today we think it is time for change, real change.
Opening statements	And by that I mean that healthcare in my view is a human right and we have got to pass a Medicare for all single-payer system.
Opening statements	Under that system by the way vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now.
Opening statements	I believe that education is the future for this country and that is why I believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition-free and eliminate student debt and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street.
Opening statements	Every proposal that I have brought forth is fully paid for.
	
Biden addresses income inequality	What I meant by that is look, Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America.
Biden addresses income inequality	Ordinary middle-class Americans built America.
Biden addresses income inequality	My dad used to have an expression he said Joe a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it’s about your dignity, it’s about respect, it’s being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything’s going to be okay.
Biden addresses income inequality	Too many people who are in the middle class and poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal.
Biden addresses income inequality	What I am saying is that we’ve got to be straightforward.
Biden addresses income inequality	We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it.
Biden addresses income inequality	They have to make sure that we (INAUDIBLE) situation where there’s continuing education and they are able to pay for it and they have to make sure that they are able to breathe air that is–is–is clean and they–they have water that they can drink.
Biden addresses income inequality	Look, Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation.
Biden addresses income inequality	We do have enormous income inequality and one thing I agree honestly can make massive cuts in the $1.6 trillion in tax loopholes out there and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy.
	
Sen. Harris on whether candidates should explain how to pay for their proposals	Well, let me tell you something.
Sen. Harris on whether candidates should explain how to pay for their proposals	I–I hear that question, but where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that–that benefits the top 1 percent and—the biggest corporations in the–this country, contributing at least a–$1 trillion to the debt of America, which middle-class families will pay for one way or another.
Sen. Harris on whether candidates should explain how to pay for their proposals	Working families need support and need to be lifted up, and frankly this economy is not working or working people.
Sen. Harris on whether candidates should explain how to pay for their proposals	For too long, the rules have been written in the favor of the people who have the most and not in favor of the people who work the most, which why I am proposing that we change the tax code so, for every family that is making less than $100,000 year, they will receive a tax credit that they can collect, up to $500 a month, which will make all the difference between those families being able to get through the end of the month with dignity and was support or not.
Sen. Harris on whether candidates should explain how to pay for their proposals	And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill that benefits the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in America.
	
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	Well, I think that the bottom line is, if we don’t clearly define that we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way they can and–and call us socialists.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	And if you look at the Green New Deal, which I admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change, I’m a scientist, but we can’t promise every American a government job if you want to get universal healthcare coverage.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	I believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege, but you can’t expect to eliminate private insurance for 180 million people, many of whom don’t want to give it up.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	In Colorado, we brought businesses and nonprofits together.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We got to near universal healthcare coverage.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We were the first state in America to–to bring the environmental community and the oil and gas industry to address, aggressively address methane emissions.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	And we were also the first place to–to expand reproductive rights on a scale basis that we reduced teen pregnancy by 54 percent.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We’ve done the big progressive things people said it couldn’t be done.
Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	I’ve done what pretty much everyone else up here is still talking about doing.
	
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	I got $100,000 in student loan debt myself.
Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	I tell you–if I count on the people who have been in government for the past 30 years who were around when this problem was created to be the ones to solve it it is going to be the next generation, the 40 million of us who can’t start a family.

Closing Statements	Closing now?
Closing Statements	Together we are on a mission.
Closing Statements	We’re on a mission to find the America that’s been lost, lost through infighting, lost through inaction.
Closing Statements	We’re so much better than this.
Closing Statements	We’re a country that used to do things.
Closing Statements	We saved the world.
Closing Statements	We created the American dream for millions of people like myself, the grandson of immigrants, the son of a union electrician who went on to become a successful business leader and create thousands of jobs.
Closing Statements	But we did these things with real solutions, not with impossible promises.
Closing Statements	And those are the roots that we have to get back to.
Closing Statements	I’m running for president to solve these problems, to build infrastructure, to fix our broken health care system, to invest in communities that have been left behind, to improve public education.
Closing Statements	I just don’t want to be your president to be your president.
Closing Statements	I want to be your president to do the job.
Closing Statements	This is not about me.
Closing Statements	This is about getting America working again.
Closing Statements	It matters.
Closing Statements	It matters in this fight for the heart and soul of our party that we nominate a candidate who has seen the face of poverty and didn’t just talk about it, but gave people $15 minimum wage.
Closing Statements	It matters that we nominate a candidate who saw the destruction wrought by a broken health care system and gave people universal health care.
Closing Statements	It matters that we choose someone who saw the wasted potential of our children denied pre-K and gave it to every single one of them for free.
Closing Statements	These things really matter.
Closing Statements	And these are the things that I’ve done in New York and I want to do the same for this whole country, because putting working people first, it matters.
Closing Statements	We need to be that party again.
Closing Statements	Let’s work together.
Closing Statements	With your help, we can put working people first again in America.
Closing Statements	(OFF-MIKE) grandchildren, we love them all.
Closing Statements	And when I was thinking about whether to run for president, I made a decision.
Closing Statements	I decided that on my last day on Earth, I wanted to look them in the eye and tell them I did everything humanly possible to protect them from the ravages of the climate crisis.
Closing Statements	And I know to a moral certainty, if we do not have the next president who commits to this as the top priority, it won’t get done.
Closing Statements	And I am the only candidate — frankly, I’m surprised.
Closing Statements	I’m the only candidate who’s made this commitment to make it the top priority.
Closing Statements	If you join me in that recognition of how important this is, we can have a unified national mission.
Closing Statements	We can save ourselves.
Closing Statements	We can save our children.
Closing Statements	We can save our grandchildren.
Closing Statements	And we can save literally the life on this planet.
Closing Statements	This is our moment.
Closing Statements	There’s nothing worse than not being heard.
Closing Statements	Nothing worse than not being seen.
Closing Statements	And I know that because I’ve represented for 17 years in Congress a forgotten community.
Closing Statements	They’ve tried to divide us, who’s white, who’s black, who’s gay, who’s straight, who’s a man, who’s a woman.
Closing Statements	And they ran away with all the gold because they divided the working class.
Closing Statements	It’s time for us to come together.
Closing Statements	I don’t know how you feel, but I’m ready to play some offense.
Closing Statements	I come from the middle of industrial America, but these problems are all over our country.
Closing Statements	There’s a tent city in L.A. There’s homeless people and people around our country who can’t afford a home.
Closing Statements	It’s time for us to get back on track.
Closing Statements	The teacher in Texas, the nurse in New Hampshire, the waitress in Wisconsin, all of us coming together, playing offense with an agenda that lifts everybody up.
Closing Statements	I will only promise you one thing.
Closing Statements	When I walk into that Oval Office every morning, you will not be forgotten.
Closing Statements	Your voice will be heard.
Closing Statements	Thank you.
Closing Statements	Our nation was founded on the principles of service above self, people who fled kings, who literally prospered on the backs and the sacrifices of people, coming here to this country, instead putting in place a government that is of, by, and for the people.
Closing Statements	But that’s not what we have.
Closing Statements	Instead, we have a government that is of, by, and for the rich and powerful.
Closing Statements	This must end.
Closing Statements	As president, our White House — our White House will be a beacon of light, providing hope and opportunity, ushering in a new century where every single person will be able to get the health care they need, where we will have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink, where we will have good-paying jobs and a new green economy.
Closing Statements	Join me in ushering in this new century with peace, prosperity, opportunity, and justice for all.
Closing Statements	Me llamo Julian Castro, y estoy postolando por presidente de los Estados Unidos.
Closing Statements	The very fact that I can say that tonight shows the progress that we have made in this country.
Closing Statements	Like many of you, I know the promise of America.
Closing Statements	My grandmother came here when she was 7 years old as an immigrant from Mexico, and just two generations later, one of her grandsons is serving in the United States Congress and the other one is running for president of the United States.
Closing Statements	If I’m elected president, I will work hard every single day so that you and your family can get good health care, your child can get a good education, and that you can have good job opportunities, whether you live in a big city or a small town.
Closing Statements	And on January 20, 2021, we’ll say adios to Donald Trump.
Closing Statements	Three things to know about me.
Closing Statements	First, I listen to people and that’s how I get things done.
Closing Statements	That is my focus.
Closing Statements	I have a track record of passing over 100 bills where I’m the lead Democrat.
Closing Statements	And that is because I listened and I acted.
Closing Statements	And I think that’s important in a president.
Closing Statements	Everything else just melts away.
Closing Statements	Secondly, I’m someone that can win and beat Donald trump.
Closing Statements	I have won every place, every race, and every time.
Closing Statements	I have won in the reddest of districts, ones that Donald Trump won by over 20 points.
Closing Statements	I can win in states like Wisconsin and Iowa and in Michigan.
Closing Statements	And finally, yeah, I am not the establishment party candidate.
Closing Statements	I’ve got respect, but I’m not that person.
Closing Statements	I am the one that doesn’t have a political machine, that doesn’t come from money.
Closing Statements	And I don’t make all the promises that everyone up here makes.
Closing Statements	But I can promise you this.
Closing Statements	I am going to govern with integrity.
Closing Statements	I’m going to (OFF-MIKE) I’m going to govern for you.
Closing Statements	Gracias.
Closing Statements	Fifty years ago this month, my family moved into the town I grew up in because after being denied a house because of the color of their skin, it was activists, mostly white activists, that stood up and fought for them.
Closing Statements	That’s the best of who we are as America and why when I got out of law school, I moved into the inner city of Newark to fight as a tenant lawyer for other people’s rights.
Closing Statements	I’ve taken on bullies and beat them.
Closing Statements	I’ve taken on tough fights and we’ve won.
Closing Statements	And we win those fights not by showing the worst of who we are, by rising to who’s best.
Closing Statements	Donald Trump wants us to fight him on his turf and his terms.
Closing Statements	We will beat him, I will beat him by calling this country to a sense of common purpose again.
Closing Statements	This is a referendum on him and getting rid of him, but it’s also a referendum on us, who we are, and who we must be to each other.
Closing Statements	It’s time we win this election.
Closing Statements	And the way I’ll govern is by showing the best of who we are because that’s what this country needs and deserves.
Closing Statements	Our daughter, Molly, turned 11 this week.
Closing Statements	I’m on this stage for her, for children across this country, including some her same age who’ve been separated from their parents and are sleeping on concrete floors under aluminum blankets tonight.
Closing Statements	If we’re going to be there for them, if we’re going to confront the challenges that we face, we can’t return to the same old approach.
Closing Statements	We’re going to need a new kind of politics, one directed by the urgency of the next generation, those climate activists, who are fighting not just for their future but for everyone’s, those students marching not just for their lives but for all of ours.
Closing Statements	We’ll need a movement like the one that we led in Texas.
Closing Statements	It renewed our democracy by bringing everyone in and writing nobody off.
Closing Statements	That’s how we beat Donald Trump.
Closing Statements	That’s how we bring this great country together again.
Closing Statements	Join us.
Closing Statements	This is our moment.
Closing Statements	And the generations that follow are counting on us to meet it.
Closing Statements	Thank you.
Closing Statements	It’s a great honor to be here.
Closing Statements	Never in a million years did I think I would stand on a stage like this.
Closing Statements	I was born and raised in Oklahoma.
Closing Statements	I have three older brothers.
Closing Statements	They all joined the military.
Closing Statements	I had a dream growing up.
Closing Statements	And my dream was to be a public school teacher.
Closing Statements	By the time I graduated from high school, my family — my family didn’t have the money for a college application, much less a chance for me to go to college.
Closing Statements	But I got my chance.
Closing Statements	It was a $50 a semester commuter college.
Closing Statements	That was a little slice of government that created some opportunity for a girl.
Closing Statements	And it opened my life.
Closing Statements	I am in this fight because I believe that we can make our government, we can make our economy, we can make our country work not just for those at the top.
Closing Statements	We can make it work for everyone.
Closing Statements	And I promise you this: I will fight for you as hard as I fight for my own family.
	
Their closing statements	We can’t be a forward looking party if we look to the past for leadership.
Their closing statements	I’m a congressman but also a father of a two year old and an infant.
Their closing statements	When I’m not changing diapers, I’m changing Washington.
Their closing statements	Most of the time the diapers smell better.
Their closing statements	I went to congress at 31.
Their closing statements	And I found a Washington that doesn’t work for people like you or me.
Their closing statements	It’s made of the rich and the disconnected.
Their closing statements	I was the first in my family to go to college and have student loan debt.
Their closing statements	So, I have led the effort to elect the next generation of members of Congress and we have a moment to seize.
Their closing statements	This is a can do generation.
Their closing statements	This is a generation that will end climate chaos.
Their closing statements	This is the generation that will solve student loan debt.
Their closing statements	And this is the generation that will say enough is enough and end gun violence.
Their closing statements	This generation demands bold solutions.
Their closing statements	That’s why I’m running for president.
Their closing statements	I’m sorry we haven’t talked more tonight about how we are going to beat Donald Trump.
Their closing statements	I have an idea about Donald Trump.
Their closing statements	Donald Trump is not going to be beaten just by insider politics talk.
Their closing statements	He’s not going to be beaten just by somebody who has plans.
Their closing statements	He is going to be beaten by somebody who has an idea what this man has done.
Their closing statements	This man has reached into the psyche of the American people and he has harnessed fear for political purposes.
Their closing statements	So, Mr. President, if you’re listening, I want you to hear me please–you have harnessed fear for political purposes and only love can cast that out.
Their closing statements	So, I sir, I have a feeling you know what you’re doing.
Their closing statements	I’m going to harness love for political purposes.
Their closing statements	I will meet you on that field and, sir, love will win.
Their closing statements	Thank you.
Their closing statements	Thank you.
Their closing statements	My mom and her parents came to the United States to rebuild their shattered lives 3–in the only country that they could, 300 years before that my parents family came searching religious freedom here.
Their closing statements	The ability for one generation to do better than the next is now severely at risk in the United States especially among children living in poverty like the ones I used to work for in the Denver public schools.
Their closing statements	That’s why I’m running for president.
Their closing statements	I’ve had two tough races in Colorado by bringing people together not by making empty promises.
Their closing statements	And I believe we need to build a broad coalition of Americans to beat Donald Trump and the corruption in Washington and build a new era of–of American democracy and American opportunity.
Their closing statements	This is going to be hard to do, but it’s what our parents would’ve expected.
Their closing statements	It’s what our kids deserve.
Their closing statements	–I hope you join me in this effort.
Their closing statements	Thank you.
Their closing statements	I’m a small business owner who brought that same scrappy spirit to big Colorado, one of the most progressive states in America.
Their closing statements	We’ve expanded reproductive health to–to reduce teenage abortion by 64 percent.
Their closing statements	We were the first state to legalize marijuana and we transformed our justice system in the process.
Their closing statements	We passed universal background checks in a purple state.
Their closing statements	We got to near universal healthcare coverage.
Their closing statements	We attack climate change with the toughest methane regulations in the country.
Their closing statements	And for the last three years, we’ve been the number one economy in America.
Their closing statements	You don’t need big government to do big things.
Their closing statements	I know that because I’m the one person up here who’s actually done the big progressive things everyone else is talking about.
Their closing statements	If we turn towards socialism, we run the risk of helping to reelect the worst president in American history.
Their closing statements	Women in America–women in America are on fire.
Their closing statements	We’ve marched, we’ve organized, we’ve run for office and we’ve won.
Their closing statements	But, our rights are under attack like never before by President Trump and the Republicans who want to repeal Roe v.
Their closing statements	Wade, which is why I went to the front lines in Georgia to fight for them.
Their closing statements	As president, I will take on the fights that no one else will.
Their closing statements	I stood up to the Pentagon and repealed Don’t Ask Don’t Tell.
Their closing statements	I’ve stood up to the banks and voted against the bail out twice.
Their closing statements	I’ve stood up to Trump more than any other senator in the U.S. Senate.
Their closing statements	And I have the most comprehensive approach for getting money out of politics with publicly funded elections to deal with political corruption.
Their closing statements	Now is not the time to play it safe.
Their closing statements	Now is not the time to be afraid of first.
Their closing statements	We need a president who will take on the big challenges even if she stands alone.
Their closing statements	Join me in fighting for this.
Their closing statements	First, I want to thank everyone who put me on this stage tonight.
Their closing statements	I am proof that our democracy still works.
Their closing statements	Democrats and Americans around the country have one question for their nominee and that is who can beat Donald Trump in 2020.
Their closing statements	That is the right question.
Their closing statements	And the right candidate to beat Donald Trump will be solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected and will have a vision of a trickle up economy that is already drawing thousands of disaffected Trump voters, conservatives, independents, and libertarians, as well as Democrats and progressives.
Their closing statements	I am that candidate.
Their closing statements	I can build a much broader coalition to beat Donald Trump.
Their closing statements	It is not left.
Their closing statements	It is not right.
Their closing statements	It is forward and that is where I’ll take the country in 2020.
Their closing statements	Thank you.
Their closing statements	Well, I–I just want to leave you with a couple of things.
Their closing statements	One, we need a nominee who has the ability to prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump and I will do that.
Their closing statements	Second, this election is about you.
Their closing statements	This is about your hopes and your dreams and your fears and what wakes you up at 3:00 in the morning.
Their closing statements	And that’s why I have what I call a 3:00 a.m. agenda that is about everything from what we need to do to deliver healthcare to how you will be able to pay the bills by the end of the month.
Their closing statements	And when I think about what our country needs, I promise you I will be a president who leads with a sense of dignity, with honest, speaking the truth, and giving the American family all that they need to get through the end of the month in a way that allows them to prosper.
Their closing statements	So, I hope to own–earn your support.

Their closing statements	Nothing about politics is theoretical for me.
Their closing statements	I’ve had the experience of writing a letter to my family, putting it in an envelope marked just in case and leaving it where they would know where to find it in case I didn’t come back from Afghanistan.
Their closing statements	I have the experience of being in a marriage that exists by the grace of a single vote on the U.S. Supreme Court and I have the experience of guiding a community where the per capita income was below $20,000 when I took office into a brighter future.
Their closing statements	I am running because the decisions we make in the next three or four years are going to decide how the next 30 or 40 go and when I get to the current age of the current President in the year 2055 I want to be able to look back on these years and save my generation delivered climate solutions, racial equality and an end to endless war.
Their closing statements	Help me deliver that new generation to Washington before it’s too late.
Their closing statements	I suspect people all over the country who are watching this debate are saying these are good people, they have great ideas but how come nothing really changes?
Their closing statements	How come for the last 45 years wages have been stagnant for the middle class?
Their closing statements	How come we have the highest rate of childhood poverty?
Their closing statements	How come 45 million people still have student debt West Denmark how can three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America?
Their closing statements	And here is the answer, nothing will change unless we have the guts to take on Wall Street, the insurance industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the military industrial complex in the fossil fuel industry.
Their closing statements	If we don’t have the guts to take them on we will continue to have plans, we will continue to have talk and rich will get richer and everybody else will be struggling.
Their closing statements	Thank you very much.
Their closing statements	I am running to leave this country because I think it is important we restore the soul of this nation.
Their closing statements	This President has ripped it out.
Their closing statements	He is the only President in our history who has equated racist and–and white supremacist with ordinary decent people.
Their closing statements	He is the only President who is that in engaged and embraced dictators and thumb their nose at our allies.
Their closing statements	I am secondly running for President because I think we have to restore the backbone of America.
Their closing statements	The poor and hard-working middle-class people.
Their closing statements	You can’t do that without replacing them with the dignity they once had.
Their closing statements	Lastly, we’ve got to unite the United States of America as much as anybody says we can’t.
Their closing statements	If we do, there’s not a single thing the American people can’t do.
Their closing statements	This is the United States of America.
Their closing statements	We can do anything if we’re together, together.
Their closing statements	So, God bless you all and may God protect our troops.
