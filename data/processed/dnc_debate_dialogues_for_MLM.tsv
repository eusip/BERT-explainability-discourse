587	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	BALART: Let me get to you in–in–in just a second.
830	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	We’re going to sneak in a break in a minute, but before we go, I’m going to go down the line here and I’m asking you please, for one or two words. All right? Please.
325	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	I got you. Totally get it. Go ahead. Governor Inslee?
111	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	… if I might — if I might, very briefly, and this is an important point. You know, my plan — and I’m glad to see that Senator Booker, Senator Warren, and Governor Inslee agree with me on this. My plan also includes getting rid of Section 1325 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, to go back to the way we used to treat this when somebody comes across the border, not to criminalize desperation, to treat that as a civil violation. And here’s why it’s important. We see all of this horrendous family separation. They use that law, Section 1325, to justify under the law separating little children from their families.
313	RYAN	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	Well, I — I understand…
838	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	All right.
279	DELANEY	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	This has got to be our way forward if we’re actually serious about this issue.
283	TODD	Moderator	19.0	LGBTQ	Thank you, Congresswoman Gabbard.
514	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	And I want every family to have that same freedom to do what is medically right, not (INAUDIBLE).
289	MADDOW	Moderator	19.0	LGBTQ	That’s time, Senator.
68	De Blasio	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	BLASIO: Congressman…
897	SWALWELL	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–Will you buy them back?
164	HOLT	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	We’re going to switch to another topic now. We’ve got a lot to get to. Let’s…
334	O’ROURKE	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Our existential threat is climate change. We have to confront it before it’s too late.
315	RYAN	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	I understand that. The Taliban…
216	TODD	Moderator	15.0	Guns	Congressman O’Rourke, you’re a Texan who’s campaigned — you campaigned all over the state in 2018 in the most conservative parts there. What do you tell a gun owner who may agree with you on everything else, OK, but says, you know what, the Democrats, if I vote for them in there, they’re going to take my gun away, and even though I agree with you on all these other issues — how do you have that conversation?
224	TODD	Moderator	15.0	Guns	We’ve got to…
327	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Congresswoman Gabbard?
413	GUTHRIE	Moderator		Opening statements	Thank you Senator.
501	HARRIS	Candidate	6.0	Sen. Harris’ ‘food fight’ moment	Hey, guys. You know what? America does not want to witness a food fight. They want to know how we’re going to put food on their table. So, on that point, part of the issue that is at play in America today, and we’ve all been traveling around the country, I certainly have, I’m meeting people who are working two and three jobs. You know, this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy, right? My great economy. My great economy. You ask him, well, how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours and he talks about the stock market. Well, that’s fine if you own stocks. So many families in America do not. You ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers. Well, yeah, people in America are working. They’re working two and three jobs. So, when we talk about jobs, let’s be very clear. In our America, no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table.
642	BENNET	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	When I–when I–when I see these kids at the border, I see my mom because I know she sees herself because she was separated from her parents for years during the holocaust in Poland. And for Donald Trump to be doing what he’s doing to children and their families at the borders I say this as somebody who wrote the immigration bill in 2013 that created a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people in this country that had the most progressive DREAM Act that’s ever been conceived, much less passed, it got 68 votes in the Senate, that had $46 billion of border security in it that was sophisticated 21st century border security, not a medieval wall that the president has–
920	HICKENLOOPER	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	You know I talk about constant engagement and I think the first–the first country I would go to but I understand they have been cheating and stealing intellectual property would be China because–
169	(UNKNOWN)	Candidate	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	Yes, it was.
792	SWALWELL	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	There–there’s–
618	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	No. If someone is here without documents and that is their only offense, is that person to be deported?
734	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Yeah, 30 seconds. Go ahead.
776	TODD	Moderator	16.0	Candidates on climate	Thank you vice president.
351	DELANEY	Candidate	22.0	Impeachment	I guess there’s always a first.
463	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	BALART: I think that’s like $3.2 trillion a–a year. How would you do that?
217	O’ROURKE	Candidate	15.0	Guns	Here’s how we have that conversation in Texas. I shared with them what I learned from those students who survived the Santa Fe high school shooting, a young student named Bree. Her friend, Marcel, who survived another shooting, the mother of a victim who lost her life, Rhonda Hart, they talked about universal background checks, where you close every loophole. We know that they save lives. We talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities. Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible. They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities. Red flag laws, so if someone poses a danger to themselves or to someone else, they’re stopped before it’s too late. And what I found in each one of those 254 counties is that Democrats and independents and Republicans, gun-owners and non-gun-owners alike, agreed. But this effort must be led by the young people that you referenced at the beginning of this issue. Those students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas led the charge here in Florida, and they’ve been able to change those laws. They’re making our democracy work, ensuring that our values and our interests and our priorities are reflected in the laws that we pass.
947	MADDOW	Moderator	22.0	Biden on why Americans should trust his foreign policy judgment after he expressed regret for supporting the Iraq war	Senator Sanders thank you.
858	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Okay. Governor Hickenlooper?
117	De Blasio	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	BLASIO: We have to change the discussion about in this country…
66	De Blasio	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	BLASIO: Wait, wait, wait. Congressman O’Rourke, Congressman O’Rourke, private insurance is not working for tens of millions of Americans when you talk about the co-pays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out of pocket expenses. It’s not working. How can you defend a system that’s not working?
410	SANDERS	Candidate		Opening statements	Well, you are quite right. We have a new vision for America and at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America, while 500,000 people are sleeping out on the streets today we think it is time for change, real change. And by that I mean that healthcare in my view is a human right and we have got to pass a Medicare for all single-payer system. Under that system by the way vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now. I believe that education is the future for this country and that is why I believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition-free and eliminate student debt and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street. Every proposal that I have brought forth is fully paid for.
626	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator–
573	BIDEN	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Yes–
533	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Thank you.
43	De Blasio	Candidate	6.0	Income Inequality	BLASIO: Well, we’ve been addressing income inequality in New York City by raising wages, by raising benefits, by putting money back in the hands of working people, $15 minimum wage, paid sick days, pre-K for all, things that are making a huge difference in working people’s lives. But let me tell you, what we’re hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle for the heart and soul of our party. I want to make it clear. This is supposed to be the party of working people. Yes, we’re supposed to be for a 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy. Yes, we’re supposed to be for free college, free public college, for our young people. We are supposed to break up big corporations when they’re not serving our democracy. This Democratic Party has to be strong and bold and progressive. And in New York, we’ve proven that we can do something very different, we can put money back in the hands of working people. And let me tell you, every time you talk about investing in people and their communities, you hear folks say there’s not enough money. What I say to them every single time is, there’s plenty of money in this world, there’s plenty of money in this country. It’s just in the wrong hands. Democrats have to fix that. (APPLAUSE)
358	MADDOW	Moderator	22.0	Impeachment	Congressman, thank you. Your time is up.
585	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	BALART: Hickenlooper day one if you are–day one at the White House how do you respond?
558	SWALWELL	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	We stand in line and pay expensive prescription drugs. We have to have a healthcare guarantee. If you’re sick, you’re seen it. And in America, you never go broke because of it.
496	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	Senator Harris, I’m so sorry.
752	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–To get everyone in here–
589	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	BALART: Governor, day one, thousands of men, women and children cross the border asking for asylum for a better life. What do you do? One, day one, hour one?
26	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Top tax rate	OK, that’s time.
36	WARREN	Candidate	4.0	breaking up of tech companies	So the way I understand this, it’s there is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country. That hurts workers. It hurts small businesses. It hurts independent farmers. It hurts our economy overall. And it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy. Now, look, we’ve had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back. What’s been missing is courage, courage in Washington to take on the giants. That’s part of the corruption in this system. It has been far too long that the monopolies have been making the campaign contributions, have been funding the super PACs, have been out there making sure that their influence is heard and felt in every single decision that gets made in Washington. Where I want to start this is I want to return government to the people, and that means calling out the names of the monopolists and saying I have the courage to go after them.
284	BOOKER	Candidate	19.0	LGBTQ	It’s not enough. If I can add to this, it’s very important.
323	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	OK.
768	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	15.0	Candidates on abortion rights	–when that door closes I will guarantee women’s reproductive (INAUDIBLE) no matter what.
73	DELANEY	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	… 100 million Americans say they like their private health insurance, by the way. It should be noted that 100 million Americans — I mean, I think we should be the party that keeps what’s working and fixes what’s broken. I mean, doesn’t that make sense? I mean, we should give everyone in this country health care as a basic human right for free, full stop. But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance. Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people? And also it’s bad policy. If you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question, which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate? Every single hospital administrator said they would close. And the Medicare for all bill requires payments to stay at current Medicare rates. So to some extent, we’re supporting a bill that will have every hospital closing. I mean, my dad was a union electrician, right? I actually grew up in a working-class family. He loved the health care that the IBEW gave him. And I just always think about my dad in anything I would do from a policy perspective. He’d look at me and he’d say, good job, John, for getting health care for every American. But why are you taking my health care away?
541	BENNET	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I agree.
20	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Top tax rate	Congressman O’Rourke…
304	TODD	Moderator	20.0	Foreign Policy	Listen, I’m going to go down the line — I’m going to go down — I’m going to go down — I’m going to go down the line here. You know what, you felt — you felt like she was rebutting you. Get 30 seconds, go.
893	HARRIS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	And then–and–and–
460	SWALWELL	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	I got $100,000 in student loan debt myself. I tell you–if I count on the people who have been in government for the past 30 years who were around when this problem was created to be the ones to solve it it is going to be the next generation, the 40 million of us who can’t start a family. Can’t take a good idea and start a business and can’t buy our first home. This is the generation that’s going to be able to solve student loan debt. This generation is ready to lead.
281	GABBARD	Candidate	19.0	LGBTQ	Let me say that there is no one in our government at any level who has the right to tell any American who they should be allowed to love or who they should be allowed to marry. My record in Congress for over six years shows my commitment to fighting for LGBTQ equality. I serve on the Equality Caucus and recently voted for passage of the Equality Act. Maybe many people in this country can relate to the fact that I grew up in a socially conservative home, held views when I was very young that I no longer hold today. I’ve served with LGBTQ servicemembers, both in training and deployed downrange. I know that they would give their life for me and I would give my life for them. It is this commitment that I’ll carry through as president of the United States, recognizing that there are still people who are facing discrimination in the workplace, still people who are unable to find a home for their families. It is this kind of discrimination that we need to address.
790	MADDOW	Moderator	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	Thank you.
472	BIDEN	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	I would. I’m still holding on to that torch. I want to make it clear to you, look, the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on to educate for an education. The fact is that that’s why I propose us focusing on schools that are in distress. That’s why I think we should triple the amount of money we spend for Title I schools. That’s why I think we should have universal Pre-K. That’s why I think every single person who graduates from high school–65 out of 100 now need something beyond high school and we should provide for them to be able to get that education. That’s why there should be free community college, cutting in half the cost of college. That’s why we should be in the position where we do not have anyone have to pay back the student debt when they get out, they’re making less than $25,000 a year. Their debt is frozen. No interest payment until they get beyond that. We can’t put people in a position where they aren’t able to go on and move on. And so, folks, there’s a lot we can do, but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the 21st century. We’re not doing that now.
85	WARREN	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	… point, though, and that is that the insurance companies last year alone sucked $23 billion in profits out of the health care system, $23 billion. And that doesn’t count the money that was paid to executives, the money that was spent lobbying Washington. We have a giant industry that wants our health care system to stay the way it is, because it’s not working for families, but it’s sure as heck working for them.
254	O’ROURKE	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	I think you’ve got to bring everybody in to the decisions and the solutions to the challenges that we face. That’s why we’re traveling everywhere, listening to everyone. We were in Pacific Junction, a town that had never meaningly flooded before, just up against the Missouri River in Iowa. And every home in that community had flooded. There were farms just outside of Pacific Junction that were effectively lakes, those farmers already underwater in debt, their markets closed to them by a trade war under this administration, and now they don’t know what to do. We in our administration are going fund resiliency in those communities, in Miami, in Houston, Texas, those places that are on the front lines of climate change today. We’re going to mobilize $5 trillion in this economy over the next 10 years. We’re going to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels, and we’re going to put farmers and ranchers in the driver’s seat, renewable and sustainable agriculture, to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil, paying farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide. If all of us does all that we can, then we’re going to be able to keep this planet from warming another 2 degrees Celsius, and ensure that we match what this country can do and live up to our promise and our potential.
610	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Senator?
881	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–Are weapons–
474	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	As the youngest–as the youngest guy on the stage, I feel like I probably ought to contribute to the generation.
639	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	Last night we ask the candidates on this stage to name the greatest geopolitical threat facing the U.S. Four of them mentioned China. U.S. businesses say China steals our intellectual property and party leaders on both sides accuse China of manipulating their currency to keep the cost of goods artificially low. I’ll ask this to Senator Bennet to start off with, how would you stand up to China?
650	BUTTIGIEG	Candidate	9.0	Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	Yeah, I mean first of all, we’ve got to recognize that the China challenge really is a serious one. This is not something to dismiss or wave away. And if you look at what China is doing. They’re using technology for the perfection of dictatorship. But, their fundamental economic model isn’t gonna change because of some tariffs. I live in the industrial Midwest. Folks who aren’t in the shadow of a factory or somewhere near a soy field where I live. And manufacturers, and especially soy farmers, are hurting. Tariffs are taxes. And Americans are gonna pay on average $800 more a year because of these tariffs. Meanwhile, China is investing so that they could soon be able to run circles around us in artificial intelligence. And this president is fixated on the China relationship as if all that mattered was the export balance on dishwashers. We’ve got a much bigger issue on our hands. But in a moment when their authoritarian model is being held up as an alternative to ours because ours looks so chaotic compared to theirs right now because of our internal divisions. The biggest thing we’ve got to do is invest in our own domestic competitiveness. If we disinvest–
77	GABBARD	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	… if you — if you look at other countries in the world who have universal health care, every one of them has some form of a role of private insurance, so I think that’s what we’ve got to look at, taking the best of these ideas, but making sure unequivocally that no sick American goes without getting the care that they need, regardless of how much or little money they have in their pocket.
569	BIDEN	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I’m sorry. I beg your pardon. I didn’t hear.
447	BENNET	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	We need to get to personal healthcare. I believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with Obamacare and creating a public option that every family and every person in America can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option which for them would be like having Medicare for all or whether they want to keep their private insurance. I believe we will get there much more quickly if we do that.
361	TODD	Moderator	22.0	Impeachment	Here’s the thing. I still — Senator…
176	GABBARD	Candidate	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	Look, obviously, if there was an attack against the American — our troops, then there would have to be a response. But my point is — and it’s important for us to recognize this — is Donald Trump and his cabinet, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and others — are creating a situation that just a spark would light off a war with Iran, which is incredibly dangerous. That’s why we need to de-escalate tensions. Trump needs to get back into the Iran nuclear deal and swallow his pride, put the American people first.
437	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–Thank you. I want to be fair to all the candidates–
800	SWALWELL	Candidate	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	–Pass the torch to the generation–
449	BENNET	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	In Bernie’s bill, in Bernie’s bill I wrote–
540	SANDERS	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Just very briefly you know Mike, Medicare is the most popular–
948	TODD	Moderator	22.0	Biden on why Americans should trust his foreign policy judgment after he expressed regret for supporting the Iraq war	All right, guys.
934	SANDERS	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	It’s not one country. I think it is rebuilding trust in the United Nations and understand that we can solve conflicts without war but with diplomacy.
432	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–So, there may–
619	SWALWELL	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	No, that person can be a part of this great American experience. That person can contribute. My congressional district is one of the most diverse in America, and we see the benefits when people contribute and they become a part of the community and they’re not in the shadow economy. Day one for me, families are reunited. This president, though, for immigrants, there is nothing he will not do two separate a family, cage a child, or erase their existence by weaponizing the census. And there is nothing that we cannot do in the courts and that I will not do as president to reverse that and to make sure that families always belong together.
271	DELANEY	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	This is — I introduced the only bipartisan carbon tax bill…
177	De Blasio	Candidate	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	BLASIO: Hey, but wait a minute…
108	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Senator Booker, what would you do on day one? And this is a situation that the next president will inherit.
119	De Blasio	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	BLASIO: … because look at the bottom line here. Those tragic — that tragic photo of those — that parent, that child — and I’m saying this as a father. Every American should feel that in their heart, every American should say that is not America, those are not our values. But we have to get under the skin of why we have this crisis in our system, because we’re not being honest about the division that’s been fomented in this country. The way that American citizens have been told that immigrants somehow created their misery and their pain and their challenges, for all the American citizens out there who feel you’re falling behind or feel the American dream is not working for you, the immigrants didn’t do that to you. The big corporations did that to you. The 1 percent did that to you. We need to be the party of working people, and that includes a party of immigrants. But first we have to tell working people in America who are hurting that we’re going to be on their side every single time against those big corporations who created this mess to begin with. And remind people we’re all in this together. If we don’t change that debate, that politics that’s holding us back, we won’t get all these reforms people are talking about. That’s what we need to do as Democrats.
860	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	And Ms. Williamson, you have the last word.
411	GUTHRIE	Moderator		Opening statements	Senator Sanders I will give you 10 seconds just to ask the–answer the very direct question will you raise taxes for the middle class in a Sanders administration?
78	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Healthcare	Congresswoman, Congresswoman, thanks.
517	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Vice President Biden, your time is–
808	TODD	Moderator	17.0	On whether ‘partisan gridlock’ would disappear	Just trust us on this.
170	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	It was imperfect, but it was a good deal for that moment. I would have worked to get longer sunset periods, and that’s something we could negotiate, to get back in the deal. But the point is, Donald Trump told us when he got out of it that he was going to give us a better deal. Those were his words. And now we are a month away from the Iranians, who claim now that they’re going blow the caps on enriching uranium. And the Iranians have told us this. And so that’s where we are now. He has made us less safe than we were when he became president. So what I would do is negotiate us back into that agreement, is stand with our allies, and not give unlimited leverage to China and Russia, which is what he has done. And then, finally, I would make sure that if there is any possibility of a conflict — and we’re having this debate in Congress right now — that he comes to Congress for an authorization of military force. I would do that. And this president is literally every single day 10 minutes away from going to war, one tweet away from going to war. And I don’t think we should conduct…
773	BIDEN	Candidate	16.0	Candidates on climate	I have supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran for (INAUDIBLE).
895	SWALWELL	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–But you’re going to be the government–
519	HOLT	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	Let me–let me turn to Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders, you have basically–you basically want to scrap the private health insurance system as we know it and replace it with a government run plan. None of the states that have tried something like that, California, Vermont, New York has struggled with it, have been successful. If politicians can’t make it work in those states how would you implement it on a national level. How does this work?
723	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Thirty seconds. I want–I–what–it does sound as if you haven’t seen what’s been happening in the United States Senate over the last 12 years. It didn’t happen. Why?
205	WARREN	Candidate	15.0	Guns	We need to fight for our children.
309	RYAN	Candidate	20.0	Foreign Policy	And they were — yeah, exactly. Well, we were.
87	INSLEE	Candidate	9.0	Abortion	It should not be an option in the United States of America for any insurance company to deny a woman coverage for their exercise of their right of choice. And I am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a woman’s right of reproductive health in health insurance, and I’m the only candidate who has passed a public option. And I respect everybody’s goals and plans here, but we do have one candidate that’s actually advanced the ball. And we’ve got to have access for everyone. I’ve done it as a public option.
112	(UNKNOWN)	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	Thank you.
91	HOLT	Moderator	9.0	Abortion	I am fascinated by this. Senator — Senator Klobuchar?
754	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	–Thank you–
899	MADDOW	Moderator	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Senator Harris, we’re going to give you 30 seconds here.
338	BOOKER	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	Nuclear proliferation and climate change.
930	BIDEN	Candidate	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	We know NATO will fall apart if he is elected for more years it is the single most consequential alliance–
174	GABBARD	Candidate	13.0	Iran Nuclear Deal	Let’s deal with the situation where we are, where this president and his chickenhawk cabinet have led us to the brink of war with Iran. I served in the war in Iraq at the height of the war in 2005, a war that took over 4,000 of my brothers and sisters in uniforms’ lives. The American people need to understand that this war with Iran would be far more devastating, far more costly than anything that we ever saw in Iraq. It would take many more lives. It would exacerbate the refugee crisis. And it wouldn’t be just contained within Iran. This would turn into a regional war. This is why it’s so important that every one of us, every single American, stand up and say no war with Iran. We need to get back into the Iran nuclear agreement, and we need to negotiate how we can improve it. It was an imperfect deal. There are issues, like their missile development, that needs to be addressed. We can do both simultaneously to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and preventing us from going to war.
781	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	16.0	Candidates on climate	Well, first of all where Bernie left off we have heard a lot of good ideas on this stage tonight and a lot of plans but the truth is until you go to the root of the corruption, the money in the–in politics, the fact that Washington is run by these special interest you are never going to solve any of these problems. I have the most comprehensive approach that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption to get money out of politics through publicly funded elections, to have clean elections. If we do that and get money out of politics we can guarantee healthcare as a right not a privilege we can deal with institutional racism, we can’t take on income inequality and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs Washington.
703	HARRIS	Candidate	12.0	Sen. Harris dramatically confronts Biden on his civil rights record	–That’s why we have the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act. That’s why we need to pass the Equality Act. That’s why we need to pass the ERA because there are–
95	HOLT	Moderator	10.0	Abortion	Senator Warren, would you put limits on — any limits on abortion?
82	BOOKER	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	… which is every American having health care.
836	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Senator Gillibrand?
574	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	–Which is different than Obama Care.
445	GILLIBRAND	Candidate	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	–It definitely wasn’t me–
492	SANDERS	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	–To take on Wall Street, to take on the fossil fuel industry, to take on the big money interest who have unbelievable influence over the economic and political life of this country.
228	DELANEY	Candidate	16.0	Supreme Court Nominees	Rachel, we have to actually…
614	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Thank you–
779	SANDERS	Candidate	16.0	Candidates on climate	No, absolutely not. Unlike the Republican party we encourage diverse city, we believe in diverse city, that is what America is up about. But in addition to diversity in terms of having more women, more people from the GB–L–LGBT community we also have to do something else and that is we have to ask ourselves a simple question and that how come to day the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1 percent has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth. We need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interest who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.
648	YANG	Candidate	9.0	Yang and Mayor Buttigieg on concerns about China	Well, I just want to agree that I think Russia is our biggest geopolitical threat because they’ve been hacking our democracy successfully. They’ve been laughing their asses off about it for the last couple of years and we should focus on that before we start worrying about other threats. Now, China, they do–they do (INAUDIBLE) property. It’s a massive problem. But the tariffs and the trade war are just punishing businesses and producers and workers on both sides. I met with a farmer in Iowa who said he spent six years building up a buying relationship in China that’s now disappeared and gone forever. And the beneficiaries have not been American workers or–or people in China. It’s been Southeast Asia and other producers that have then stepped into the void. So, we need to–to crack down on Chinese malfeasance in the trade relationship but the tariffs and the trade war are the wrong way to go.
933	TODD	Moderator	21.0	Candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president	Senator Sanders?
644	BENNET	Candidate	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Turned the border of the United States into a symbol of nativist hostility that the whole world is looking at when what we should be represented by is–
256	CASTRO	Candidate	18.0	Climate Change	Well, I don’t think that that represents the vast majority of the issue. In fact, you know, my first visit after I announced my candidacy wasn’t to Iowa or New Hampshire. It was to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Because people should know that if I’m elected president, everybody will count. And, you know, I’m one of the few candidates in this race with executive experience, with a track record of getting things done. When I was mayor of San Antonio, we moved our local public utility, we began to shift it from coal-fired plants to solar and other renewables, and also created more than 800 jobs doing that. And when I was HUD secretary, we worked on the National Disaster Resilience Competition to invest in communities that were trying to rebuild from natural disasters in a sustainable way. That’s the way that we’re going to help make sure that we’re all safer in the years to come and that we combat climate change.
22	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Top tax rate	Congressman, that’s time, sir. I’ll give you 10 seconds to answer if you want to answer the direct question. Would you support a 70 percent individual marginal tax rate? Yes, no, or pass?
676	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	All of these issues are extremely important but there are specifics, there are symptoms. And the underlying cause has to do with deep, deep, deep realms of racial injustice. Both in our criminal justice system and in our economic system. And the democratic party should be on the side of reparations for slavery for this very reason. I do not believe–I do not believe that the average American is a racist. But the average American is woefully undereducated about the history of race in the United States.
238	TODD	Moderator	17.0	Mitch McConnell	I’m going to get to — I’m going to get a couple of you in here. I’m going to get a couple of you in here. Thirty seconds, Congressman Delaney, you seem to believe you can do everything in a bipartisan manner. Mitch McConnell doesn’t operate that way. He operates differently. Why do you think he is going to conform to your style?
468	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	BALART: OK. So, Congressman Swalwell, want to talk a little bit about what Mr. Yang is talking about and you just actually mentioned it–many Americans are worried about things like self-driving cars, robots, drones, artificial intelligence will cost them their jobs. What would you to help people get the skills they need to adapt to this new world?
499	(UNKNOWN)	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	been part of the issue–
883	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	–Are from the military–
840	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Senator Harris?
263	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	Thank you, Congressman Ryan.
765	MADDOW	Moderator	15.0	Candidates on abortion rights	Thank you.
678	HARRIS	Candidate	11.0	Mayor Buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown	I would like to say–
833	SWALWELL	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	For Parkland, for Orlando, for every community effected by gun violence, ending gun violence.
352	MADDOW	Moderator	22.0	Impeachment	Should he be?
330	GABBARD	Candidate	21.0	Biggest Geopolitical Threat	The greatest threat that we face is the fact that we’re in a greater risk of nuclear war today than ever before in history.
854	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	Mayor Buttigieg, your first priority, your first issue as president that you are going to block and tackle?
843	HARRIS	Candidate	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	DACA, guns.
130	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	I just think it’s a mistake, Beto. I think it’s a mistake. And I think that — that if you truly want to change the system, that we’ve got to repeal that section. If not…
534	WILLIAMSON	Candidate	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	It even has to do with environmental policies.
746	TODD	Moderator	14.0	Candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with Mitch McConnell	Thank you, Senator Gillibrand. Thank you.
622	DIAZ-BALART	Moderator	8.0	Candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants	–Senator–
92	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	9.0	Abortion	I just want to say, there’s three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a woman’s right to choose. I’ll start with that. And then I just want to make very clear, I think we share the goal of universal health care. And the idea I put out there, the public option, which the governor was just talking about, this idea is that you use Medicare or Medicaid without any insurance companies involved, you can do it either way. And the estimates are 13 million people would see a reduction in their premiums, 12 more million people would get covered. So I think it is a beginning and the way you start and the way you move to universal health care.
114	CASTRO	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	And so I want to challenge every single candidate on this stage to support the repeal of Section 1325.
832	TODD	Moderator	19.0	Candidates on what their first issue would be if elected	President Obama, in his first year, wanted to address both healthcare and climate and he could only get one signature issue accomplished. It was, obviously, healthcare. He didn’t get to do climate change. You may only get one shot and your first issue that you’re going to push–you get one shot that it may be the only thing you get passed, what is that first issue for your presidency? Eric Swalwell, you’re first.
155	KLOBUCHAR	Candidate	12.0	Undocumented Immigrants	It gives a path for citizenship for citizen — for people who can become citizens. And it will be so much better for our economy in America.
276	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	Thank you. Congressman, thank you.
443	GUTHRIE	Moderator	3.0	Candidates are asked about ‘socialism’	It was you.
760	MADDOW	Moderator	15.0	Candidates on abortion rights	Senator
476	SANDERS	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	As part of Joe’s generation–
898	SANDERS	Candidate	20.0	Candidates on gun control	Yeah.
464	YANG	Candidate	5.0	Rep. Swalwell and Biden on generational change, and Yang explains his economic plan	I’m sorry?
45	DELANEY	Candidate	6.0	Income Inequality	I think we have to do real things to help American workers and the American people. Right? This is the issue that all of us hear on the campaign trail. We need to make sure everyone has a living wage. And I’ve called for a doubling of the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating paid family leave. That will create a situation where people actually have a living wage. That gets right to workers. Then we’ve got to fix our public education system. It’s not delivering the results our kids needs, nor is college and post high school career and technical training programs doing that. You know, I’m very different than everyone else here on the stage. Prior to being in Congress, I was an entrepreneur. I started two businesses. I created thousands of jobs. I spent my whole career helping small- to mid-sized businesses all over the country, 5,000 of them I supported. The Obama administration gave me an award for lending to disadvantaged communities. I know how to create jobs. We need a short-term strategy which is to put money in the pockets of workers with the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating family leave, and then we need to have a long-term strategy to make sure this country is competitive and we’re creating jobs everywhere in this country.
570	GUTHRIE	Moderator	7.0	Candidates weigh in on healthcare	I believe at the show of hands you did not raise her hand. Did you raise your hand?
61	O’ROURKE	Candidate	8.0	Healthcare	My goal is to ensure that every American is well enough to live to their full potential because they have health care. In Laredo, Texas, I met a young man, 27 years old, told me that he’d been to a doctor once in his life. And on that visit, he was told he had diabetes, he was told he had glaucoma, and he was told untreated — because he doesn’t have health care — he’ll be dead before the age of 40. So getting to guaranteed, high-quality, universal health care as quickly and surely as possible has to be our goal. The ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider, to be — the ability to see a mental health care provider. In Texas, the single largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system today. And health care also has to mean that every woman can make her own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible. Our plan says that if you’re uninsured, we enroll you in Medicare. If you’re insufficiently insured, you can’t afford your premiums, we enroll you in Medicare. But if you’re a member of a union that negotiated for a health care plan that you like because it works for you and your family, you’re able to keep it.
257	TODD	Moderator	18.0	Climate Change	Thank you.
62	HOLT	Moderator	8.0	Healthcare	Your time is up.
209	MADDOW	Moderator	15.0	Guns	Secretary Castro, I’d like to talk to you about something that Senator Booker just mentioned there, the idea of active shooter drills in schools, as school shootings seem like an almost everyday or every week occurrence now. They don’t make a complete news cycle anymore, no matter the death toll. As parents are so afraid as their kids go off to school that their kids will be caught up in something like this, next to nothing has changed in federal law that might affect the prevalence of school shootings. Is this a problem that is going to continue to get worse over our lifetimes? Or is there something that you would do as president that you really think would turn it around?
51	RYAN	Candidate	7.0	Manufacturing Jobs	… and manufacture those here in the United States.
