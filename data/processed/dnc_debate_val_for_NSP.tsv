So I think of it this way.
Who is this economy really working for?
It’s doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top.
It’s doing great for giant drug companies.
It’s just not doing great for people who are trying to get a prescription filled.
It’s doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons, just not for the African-Americans and Latinos whose families are torn apart, whose lives are destroyed, and whose communities are ruined.
It’s doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us.
When you’ve got a government, when you’ve got an economy that does great for those with money and isn’t doing great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple.
We need to call it out.
We need to attack it head on.
And we need to make structural change in our government, in our economy, and in our country.
So, in this period of time that I have been running for president, I’ve had more than 100 town halls.
I’ve taken more than 2,000 unfiltered questions.
And the single hardest questions I’ve gotten, I got one from a little boy and I got one from a little girl, and that is to say, when you’re president, how are you going to keep us safe?
That’s our responsibility as adults.
Seven children will die today from gun violence, children and teenagers.
And they won’t just die in mass shootings.
They’ll die on sidewalks, they’ll die in playgrounds, they’ll die in people’s backyards.
Gun violence is a national health emergency in this country.
And we need to treat it like that.
So what can we do?
We can do the things that are sensible.
We can do the universal background checks.
We can ban the weapons of war.
But we can also double down on the research and find out what really works, where it is that we can make the differences at the margins that will keep our children safe.
We need to treat this like the virus that’s killing our children.
I do.
We are democracy.
And the way a democracy is supposed to work is the will of the people matters.
Now, we have for far too long have had a Congress in Washington that has just completely dismissed what people care about across this country.
They have made this country work much better than for those who can make giant contributions, made it work better for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers, and not made it work for the people.
Well, here’s how I see this happening.
Number one, sure, I want to see us get a Democratic majority in the Senate.
But short of a Democratic majority in the Senate, you better understand the fight still goes on.
It starts in the White House, and it means that everybody we energize in 2020 stays on the frontlines come January 2021.
We have to push from the outside, have leadership from the inside, and make this Congress reflect the will of the people.
Yes, first by taking away the filibuster from Mitch McConnell, to start with.
We have to do that.
Look it, look it, we are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change, and we are the last that can do something it.
Our towns are burning.
Our fields are flooding.
Miami is inundated.
And we have to understand, this is a climate crisis, an emergency (OFF-MIKE) this is our last chance in the administration, next one, to do something about it.
And we need to do what I’ve done in my state.
We’ve passed a 100 percent clean electrical grid bill.
We now have a vision statement.
And my plan has been called the gold standard of putting people to work.
But the most important thing on this, in the biggest decision for the American public is, who is going to make this the first priority?
And I am the candidate and the only one who’s saying this has to be the top priority of the United States, the organizing principle to mobilize the United States, so that we can do what we’ve always done, lead the world and invent the future and put 8 million people to work.
That’s what we’re going to do.
One of the most powerful pieces of art in the United States Capitol is the Trumbull painting of General George Washington resigning his commission to the Continental Congress, at the height of his power, submitting to the rule of law and the will of people.
That has withstood the test of time for the last 243 years.
If we set another precedent now that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power, a president who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy, if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity, then we will have set a new standard, and that is that some people, because of the position of power and public trust that they hold, are above the law.
And we cannot allow that to stand.
So we must begin impeachment now so that we have the facts and the truth and we follow them as far as they go and as high up as they reach and we save this democracy.
And if we’ve not been able to do that in this year or the year that follows, and under my administration, our Department of Justice will pursue these facts and ensure that there are consequences, there is accountability, and there is justice.
It’s the only way that we save this country.
Sure.
So, college affordability is personal for us.
Chasten and I have six figure student debt.
I believe in reducing student debt.
It’s logical to me that if you can refinance your house you ought to be able to refinance your student debt.
I also believe in free college for low and middle income students for whom cost could be a barrier.
I just don’t believe it makes sense to ask working class families to subsidize even the children of billionaires.
I think the children of the wealthiest Americans can pay at least a little bit of tuition.
And while I want — want tuition costs to go down I don’t think we can buy down every last penny for that.
Now, there’s something else that doesn’t get talked about in the college affordability debate.
Yes, it needs to be more affordable in this country to go to college.
It also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college.
You should be able to live well, afford rent, be generous to your children– (INAUDIBLE) little league whether you went to college or not.
That’s one of many reasons we need to raise the minimum wage to at least $15.00 an hour.
So, this is a very important issue.
So, the plan that Senator Sanders and I and other support Medicare for All is how you get to single payer, but it has a buy in transition period, which is really important.
In 2005 when I ran for Congress in a two to one republican district, I actually ran on Medicare for All and I won that two to one republican district twice.
And the way I formulated it was simple.
Anyone who doesn’t have access to insurance they like, they could buy it in a percentage of income they could afford.
So, that’s what we put into the transition period for our Medicare for All Plan.
I believe we need to get to universal healthcare as a right, not a privilege to single payer.
The quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers.
God bless the insurers if they want to compete, they can certainly try.
But, they’d never put people over their profits and I doubt they ever will.
So, what will happen is people will choose Medicare.
You will transition.
We would get to Medicare for All.
And then your step to single payer is so short.
I would make it an earned benefit just like Social Security, so that you buy in your whole life.
It is always there for you and it’s permanent and it’s universal.
Immediately on January 20th of 2021 I will first of all we cannot forget our DACA recipients so I’m going to start there.
I will immediately by executive action reinstate DACA status and DACA protection to those young people.
I will further extend protection for deferral of deportation for their parents and for veterans who we have so many who are undocumented and who have served our country and fought for our democracy.
I will also immediately put in place immediate process for reviewing the cases for asylum.
I will release children from cages.
I will get rid of the private detention centers.
And I will ensure that the–this microphone that the President of the United States holds in her hand is use din a way that is about reflecting the values of our country and not about locking children up, separating them from their parents.
And I have to just say that we have to think about this issue in terms of real people.
A mother who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin, through the entire country of Mexico facing unknown peril to come here why would that mother do that?
I will tell you.
Because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse.
But what does Donald Trump do?
He says go back to where you came from.
That is not reflective of our America and our values and it has got to end.
Okay.
So, on the issue of race, I couldn’t agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly.
I–there is not a black man I know, be he a relative, a friend or a coworker who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination.
Growing up, my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn’t play with us because she–because we were black.
And I will say also that–that in this campaign, we’ve also heard–and I’m going to now direct this to Vice President Biden.
I do not believe you are a racist and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.
Well, first, the economy.
We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity.
And Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what’s going on, when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums.
So I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids.
I do.
But I think my plan is a good one.
And my plan would be to, first of all, make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education.
My own dad and my sister got their first degrees with community college.
There’s many paths to success, as well as certifications.
Secondly, I’d used Pell grants.
I’d double them from $6,000 to $12,000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered, to families that make up to $100,000.
And then the third thing I would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans.
Because I can tell you this: If billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.
This economy has got to work for everyone.
And right now, we know that it isn’t.
And it’s going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does.
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Right now, we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes.
That’s how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest.
A $2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality.
A new democracy that is revived because we’ve returned power to the people, no PACs, no gerrymandering, automatic and same-day voter registration to bring in more voters, and a new Voting Rights Act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now…
I don’t think I disagree.
I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation.
And you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from labor, and we have people that work full-time jobs and still can’t make a living wage.
We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs.
And you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that’s hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete.
One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector.
So I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work.
And I’ll tell you this.
I live in a low-income black and brown community.
I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans.
The indicators that are being used, from GDP to Wall Street’s rankings, is not helping people in my community.
It is about time that we have an economy that works for everybody, not just the wealthiest in our nation.
Thank you very much for that question, Lester.
You know, I grew up with a mother who raised my brother, Joaquin, and me as a single parent.
And I know what it’s like to struggle.
I know what it’s like to rent a home and to worry about whether you’re going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month and to see a mom work very, very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because they’re women.
I would do several things, starting with something we should have done a long time ago, which is to pass the Equal Rights Amendment finally in this country.
And also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country.
It’s past time that we did that.
And, you know, we have to do this.
If we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century, we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve.
Well, we’ve been addressing income inequality in New York City by raising wages, by raising benefits, by putting money back in the hands of working people, $15 minimum wage, paid sick days, pre-K for all, things that are making a huge difference in working people’s lives.
But let me tell you, what we’re hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle for the heart and soul of our party.
I want to make it clear.
This is supposed to be the party of working people.
Yes, we’re supposed to be for a 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy.
Yes, we’re supposed to be for free college, free public college, for our young people.
We are supposed to break up big corporations when they’re not serving our democracy.
This Democratic Party has to be strong and bold and progressive.
And in New York, we’ve proven that we can do something very different, we can put money back in the hands of working people.
And let me tell you, every time you talk about investing in people and their communities, you hear folks say there’s not enough money.
What I say to them every single time is, there’s plenty of money in this world, there’s plenty of money in this country.
It’s just in the wrong hands.
Democrats have to fix that.
(APPLAUSE)
Yes, I believe you can, but, first, let’s say the president came, he said don’t sell your house to people in Youngstown, Ohio.
And then his administration just in the last two years, we lost $4,000 — 4,000 jobs at a General Motors facility.
That rippled throughout our community.
General Motors got a tax cut.
General Motors got a bailout.
And then they have the audacity to move a new car that they’re going to produce to Mexico.
I’ve had family members that have to unbolt a machine from the factory floor, put it in a box, and ship it to China.
My area where I come from in northeast Ohio, this issue we’re talking about here, it’s been going on 40 years.
This is not a new phenomenon in the United States of America.
The bottom 60 percent haven’t seen a raise since 1980.
Meanwhile, the top 1 percent control 90 percent of the wealth.
We need an industrial policy saying we’re going to dominate building electric vehicles, there’s going to be 30 million made in the next 10 years.
I want half of them made in the United States.
I want to dominate the solar industry…
Well, I think it’s a bold approach.
It’s something that Barack Obama wanted to do when we were working on the Affordable Care Act.
And that is a public option.
I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in four years, which is exactly what this bill says.
So let me go on beyond that.
There is a much bigger issue in addition to that, and that is pharmaceuticals.
The president literally went on TV, on Fox, and said that people’s heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices.
Instead, 2,500 drugs have gone up in double-digits since he came into office.
Instead, he gave $100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies.
For the rest of us, for the rest of America, that’s what we call at home all foam and no beer.
We got nothing out of it.
And so my proposal is to do something about pharma, to take them on, to allow negotiation under Medicare, to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries.
And pharma thinks they own Washington?
Well, they don’t own me.

It should not be an option in the United States of America for any insurance company to deny a woman coverage for their exercise of their right of choice.
And I am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a woman’s right of reproductive health in health insurance, and I’m the only candidate who has passed a public option.
And I respect everybody’s goals and plans here, but we do have one candidate that’s actually advanced the ball.
And we’ve got to have access for everyone.
I’ve done it as a public option.
Your time…
Senator Klobuchar, I want to get you…
That’s a false claim.
I am fascinated by this.
Senator — Senator Klobuchar?
I just want to say, there’s three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a woman’s right to choose.
I’ll start with that.
And then I just want to make very clear, I think we share the goal of universal health care.
And the idea I put out there, the public option, which the governor was just talking about, this idea is that you use Medicare or Medicaid without any insurance companies involved, you can do it either way.
And the estimates are 13 million people would see a reduction in their premiums, 12 more million people would get covered.
So I think it is a beginning and the way you start and the way you move to universal health care.
Secretary Castro, this one is for you.
All of you on stage support a woman’s right to an abortion.
You all support some version of a government health care option.
Would your plan cover abortion, Mr. Secretary?
Yes, it would.
I don’t believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice.
And, you know, what that means is that just because a woman — or let’s also not forget someone in the trans community, a trans female, is poor, doesn’t mean they shouldn’t have the right to exercise that right to choose.
And so I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion.
More than that, everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today, a person’s right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri, in Alabama, in Georgia.
I would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of Roe v.
Wade and will respect it.… and in addition to that, make sure that we fight hard as we transition our health care system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right.
Senator Warren, would you put limits on — any limits on abortion?
I would make certain that every woman has access to the full range of reproductive health care services, and that includes birth control, it includes abortion, it includes everything for a woman.
And I want to add on that.
It’s not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us.
Forty-seven years ago, Roe v.
Wade was decided, and we’ve all looked to the courts all that time, as state after state has undermined Roe, has put in exceptions, has come right up to the edge of taking away protections.
Your time is up, Senator.
They should absolutely be held criminally liable, because they are liable and responsible.
This is one of the reasons why well before I was running for president I said I would not take contributions from pharma companies, not take contributions from corporate PACs, or pharma executives, because they are part of this problem.
And this opioid addiction in our country, we in cities like mine have been seeing how we’ve tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long.
It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that.
Congressman O’Rourke, how would you deal with it?
Tonight in this country, you have 2.3 million of our fellow Americans behind bars.
It’s the largest prison population on the face of the planet.
Many are there for nonviolent drug crimes, including possession of marijuana, at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized it.
And yet despite what Purdue Pharma has done, their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we’re seeing throughout this country, they’ve been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences, not a single night in jail.
Unless there’s accountability and justice, this crisis will continue.
In my administration, we will hold them to account.
We will make sure that they pay a price, and we will help those who’ve been victims of this malfeasance in this country get them treatment and long-term care.
Thank you very much, Jose.
I’m very proud that in April I became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan.
And we saw those images… … watching that image of Oscar and his daughter, Valeria, is heartbreaking.
It should also piss us all off.
If I were president today — and it should spur us to action.
If I were president today, I would sign an executive order that would get rid of Trump’s zero-tolerance policy, the remain in Mexico policy, and the metering policy — this metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river.
They had been playing games with people who are coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry.
Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry, and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim, so they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river, and they died because of that.
On day one.
Sorry, I’m just going to ask…
On day one, I would do that executive order that would address metering.
And then I would follow that up in my first 100 days with immigration reform that would honor asylum claims, that would put undocumented immigrants, as long as they haven’t committed a serious crime, on a pathway to citizenship.
And then we’d get to the root cause of the issue, which is we need a Marshall Plan for Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of coming to the United States to seek it.
Senator Booker, what would you do on day one?
And this is a situation that the next president will inherit.
Senator Booker, what would you do on day one?
And this is a situation that the next president will inherit.
Yes.
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) On day one, I will make sure that, number one, we end the ICE policies and the Customs and Border Policies that are violating the human rights.
When people come to this country, they do not leave their human rights at the border.
Number two…I will make sure that we reinstate DACA, that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for DACA recipients, and to make sure that people that are here on temporary protective status can stay and remain here.
And then, finally, we need to make sure that we address the issues that made Oscar and Valeria come in the first place, by making major investments in the Northern Triangle, not like this president is doing, by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem.
We cannot surrender our values and think that we’re going to get border security.
We actually will lose security and our values.
We must fight for both.
… if I might — if I might, very briefly, and this is an important point.
You know, my plan — and I’m glad to see that Senator Booker, Senator Warren, and Governor Inslee agree with me on this.
My plan also includes getting rid of Section 1325 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, to go back to the way we used to treat this when somebody comes across the border, not to criminalize desperation, to treat that as a civil violation.
And here’s why it’s important.
We see all of this horrendous family separation.
They use that law, Section 1325, to justify under the law separating little children from their families.
Thank you.
Jose…
And so I want to challenge every single candidate on this stage to support the repeal of Section 1325.
Thirty seconds.
As my friend here said, I agree with him on that issue, but folks should understand that the 	It happens in our communities, as ICE are ripping away parents from their American children, spouses and the like, and are creating fear in cities all across this country where parents are afraid to even drop their kids off to school or go to work.
We must end those policies, as well.
We have to change the discussion about in this country…
Mayor?
… because look at the bottom line here.
Those tragic — that tragic photo of those — that parent, that child — and I’m saying this as a father.
Every American should feel that in their heart, every American should say that is not America, those are not our values.
But we have to get under the skin of why we have this crisis in our system, because we’re not being honest about the division that’s been fomented in this country.
The way that American citizens have been told that immigrants somehow created their misery and their pain and their challenges, for all the American citizens out there who feel you’re falling behind or feel the American dream is not working for you, the immigrants didn’t do that to you.
The big corporations did that to you.
The 1 percent did that to you.
We need to be the party of working people, and that includes a party of immigrants.
But first we have to tell working people in America who are hurting that we’re going to be on their side every single time against those big corporations who created this mess to begin with.
And remind people we’re all in this together.
If we don’t change that debate, that politics that’s holding us back, we won’t get all these reforms people are talking about.
That’s what we need to do as Democrats.
If I could, I’m sorry.
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) What would you do, Congressman, day one at the White House??
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) We would not turn back Valeria and her father, Oscar.
We would accept them into this country and follow our own asylum laws.
We would not build walls.
We would not put kids in cages.
In fact, we would spare no expense to reunite the families that have been separated already…
… and we would not criminally prosecute any family who is fleeing violence and persecution…
… repeal of Section 1325.
We would make sure…
Secretary, let him finish.
And I will give you…
But let him finish.
Let him finish.
We would not detain any family fleeing violence, in fact, fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet today.
We would implement a family case management program so they could be cared for in the community at a fraction of the cost.
And then we would rewrite our immigration laws in our own image, free Dreamers forever from any fear of deportation by making them U.S. citizens here in this country, invest in solutions in Central America, work with regional stakeholders so there’s no reason to make that 2,000 mile journey to this country.
Thank you.
Secretary, I’ll give you 30 seconds.
Let’s be very clear.
The reason that they’re separating these little children from their families is that they’re using Section 1325 of that act which criminalizes coming across the border to incarcerate the parents and then separate them.
Some of us on this stage have called to end that section, to terminate it.
Some, like Congressman O’Rourke, have not.
And I want to challenge all of the candidate to do that.
I just think it’s a mistake, Beto.
I think it’s a mistake.
And I think that — that if you truly want to change the system, that we’ve got to repeal that section.
If not…
Thank you.
… then it might as well be the same policy.
Let me respond to this very briefly.
As a member of a Congress, I helped to introduce legislation that would ensure that we don’t criminalize those who are seeking asylum and refuge in this country.
I’m not talking about — I’m not talking about the ones that are seeking asylum.
If you’re fleeing — if you’re fleeing desperation, then I want to make sure…
I’m talking about — I’m talking about everybody else.
… I want to make sure you are treated with respect.
I’m still talking about everybody else.
But you’re looking at just one small part of this.
I’m talking about a comprehensive rewrite of our immigration laws.
That’s not true.
And if you do that, I don’t think it’s asking too much for people to follow our laws when they come to this country.
That’s actually not true.
I’m talking about millions of folks — a lot of folks that are coming are not seeking asylum.
A lot of them are undocumented immigrants, right?
And you said recently that the reason you didn’t want to repeal Section 1325 was because you were concerned about human trafficking and drug trafficking.
But let me tell you what: Section 18, title 18 of the U.S. code, title 21 and title 22, already cover human trafficking.
I think that you should do your homework on this issue.
If you did your homework on this issue, you would know that we should repeal this section.
This is an issue that we should and could be talking about for a long time, and we will for a long time.
Can we talk about the conditions about why people are coming here?
Let’s — Lester — Lester — I’m sorry, Savannah — I know, it’s just — we could go on.
But rather than talk about specific provisions, we really have to talk about why these people are coming to our country…
You’ll get your chance.
… and what we’re going to do to actually make a difference in these countries.
Congressman, you’ll get your chance.
Let’s continue the discussion.
Senator Klobuchar…
Yes.
Let’s talk about what Secretary Castro just said.
He wants to no longer have it be a crime to illegally cross the border.
Do you support that?
Do you think it should be a civil offense only?
And if so, do you worry about potentially incentivizing people to come here?
Immigrants, they do not diminish America.
They are America.
And I am happy to look at his proposal.
But I do think you want to make sure that you have provisions in place that allow you to go after traffickers and allow you to go after people who are violating the law.
What I really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here.
And that is that 70 of our Fortune 500 companies are headed by people that came from other countries.
Twenty-five percent of our U.S. Nobel laureates were born in other countries.
We have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories.
We need them to start small businesses.
We need their ideas.
And this president has literally gone backwards at a time when our economy needs immigrants.
And so my proposal is to look at that 2013 bill that passed the Senate with Republican support, to upgrade that bill, to make it as good as possible and get it done.
It brings the doubt down by $158 billion.
Senator…
It gives a path for citizenship for citizen — for people who can become citizens.
And it will be so much better for our economy in America.
Senator, that’s time.
Thank you.
Congressman Ryan, same question.
Should it be a crime to illegally cross the border?
Or should it be a civil offense only?
Well, I agree with Secretary Castro.
I think there are other provisions in the law that will allow you to prosecute people for coming over here if they’re dealing drugs and other things.
That’s already established in the law.
So there’s no need to repeat it.
And I think it’s abhorrent — we’re talking about this father who got killed with his daughter, and the issues here — the way these kids are being treated.
If you go to Guantanamo Bay, there are terrorists that are held that get better health care than those kids that have tried to cross the border in the United States.
That needs to stop.
And I think the president should immediately ask doctors and nurses to go immediately down to the border and start taking care of these kids.
What kind of country are we running here where we have a president of the United States who’s so focused on hate and fear and division?
And what has happened now, the end result is now we’ve got kids literally laying in their own snot, with three-week-old diapers that haven’t been changed.
We’ve got to tell this president that is not a sign of strength, Mr. President.
That is a sign of weakness.
Senator Booker — a lot of people — they asked the question, if you’re president on day one, what will you do with the fact that you will have families here?
There’s been a lot of talk about what you’ll do in the first 100 days about legislation.
What will you actually do with these families?
How will you care for them?
Will they be detained or will they not be?
Well, this is a related and brief point, because what we’re talking — what Secretary Castro and I are talking about is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process.
I have been to some of the largest private prisons, which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration, and their immigration lockups.
Our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things, whether it’s immigration, whether it’s mental illness, whether it’s addiction.
We know that this is not the way to deal with problems.
There is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solves this problem.
Donald Trump isn’t solving this problem.
We’ve seen under his leadership a surge at our border.
We solve this problem by making investments in the Northern Triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place, and we make sure we use our resources to provide health care to affirm the values and human dignity of the people that come here, because we cannot sacrifice our values, our ideals as a nation for border security.
We can have both by doing this the right way.
All right, Senator, thank you.
Let me go to Governor Inslee on this.
What would you do on day one?
Same question I just asked Cory Booker.
I have yet to hear an answer from anyone on this stage.
There is no reason…
What will you do with the families that will be here?
There is no reason for the detention and separation of these children.
They should be released, pending their hearings, and they should have a hearing and the law should be followed.
That’s what should happen.
And we should do what we’re doing in Washington state.
I’m proud that we’ve passed a law that prevents local law enforcement from being turned into mini-ICE agents.
I’m proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump’s heinous Muslim ban.
I’m proud to be a person who’s not only talked about Dreamers, but being one of the first to make sure that they get a college education, so that they can realize their dreams.
These are some of the most inspirational people in our state.
And I’ll leave you with this thought, if you want to know what I think.
Donald Trump the other day tried to threaten me — he thought it was a threat — to tell me that he would send refugees into Washington state if we passed a law that I passed.
And I told him that’s not a threat at all.
We welcome refugees into our state.
We recognize diversity as a strength.
This is how we’ve built America.
That tradition is going to continue if I’m president of the United States.
We’re going to switch to another topic now.
We’ve got a lot to get to.
Let’s…
May I address that?
First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal.
And one of the reasons why we’re seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation.
Literally, he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years.
And now we see Iran threatening to go further and who are pulled — being pulled further and further into this crisis.
We need to renegotiate and get back into a deal, but I’m not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally I’m going to rejoin that deal.
Because when I’m president of the United States, I’m going to do the best I can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if I have an opportunity to leverage a better deal, I’m going to do it.
All right, Senator Klobuchar, I’d like to ask you to answer that question, because you’ve said — you’ve said you would negotiate yourself back into the Iranian agreement.
Can you argue that that nuclear pact as it was ratified was a good deal?
Yes, it was.
It was imperfect, but it was a good deal for that moment.
I would have worked to get longer sunset periods, and that’s something we could negotiate, to get back in the deal.
But the point is, Donald Trump told us when he got out of it that he was going to give us a better deal.
Those were his words.
And now we are a month away from the Iranians, who claim now that they’re going blow the caps on enriching uranium.
And the Iranians have told us this.
And so that’s where we are now.
He has made us less safe than we were when he became president.
So what I would do is negotiate us back into that agreement, is stand with our allies, and not give unlimited leverage to China and Russia, which is what he has done.
And then, finally, I would make sure that if there is any possibility of a conflict — and we’re having this debate in Congress right now — that he comes to Congress for an authorization of military force.
I would do that.
And this president is literally every single day 10 minutes away from going to war, one tweet away from going to war.
And I don’t think we should conduct…
All right, your time is up.
…  in our bathrobe at 5:00 in the morning, which is what he does.
Congresswoman Gabbard, Congresswoman Gabbard, you’ve said you would sign back on to the 2015 deal.
Would you — would you insist, though, that it address Iran’s support for Hezbollah?
Let’s deal with the situation where we are, where this president and his chickenhawk cabinet have led us to the brink of war with Iran.
I served in the war in Iraq at the height of the war in 2005, a war that took over 4,000 of my brothers and sisters in uniforms’ lives.
The American people need to understand that this war with Iran would be far more devastating, far more costly than anything that we ever saw in Iraq.
It would take many more lives.
It would exacerbate the refugee crisis.
And it wouldn’t be just contained within Iran.
This would turn into a regional war.
This is why it’s so important that every one of us, every single American, stand up and say no war with Iran.
We need to get back into the Iran nuclear agreement, and we need to negotiate how we can improve it.
It was an imperfect deal.
There are issues, like their missile development, that needs to be addressed.
We can do both simultaneously to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and preventing us from going to war.
Your time is up.
And this is a very quick follow-up.
But what would your red line be that would — for military action against Iran?
Look, obviously, if there was an attack against the American — our troops, then there would have to be a response.
But my point is — and it’s important for us to recognize this — is Donald Trump and his cabinet, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and others — are creating a situation that just a spark would light off a war with Iran, which is incredibly dangerous.
That’s why we need to de-escalate tensions.
Trump needs to get back into the  and swallow his pride, put the American people first.
Hey, but wait a minute…
I’m going to use 20 of my seconds just to say there’s one thing we don’t all agree with when it comes to guns, and I think it’s common sense, and over 70 percent of Americans agree with me.
If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to buy and own a firearm.
And not everybody in this field agrees with that.
But in states like Connecticut that did that, they saw 40 percent drops in gun violence and 15 percent drops in suicides.
We need to start having bold agendas on guns.
When it comes to the Supreme Court, very clearly, we — I agree with my friend, Secretary Castro.
We are going to get to 50 votes in the Senate.
This is a team sport.
Whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like South Carolina, because we can elect Jamie Harrison.
They need to campaign in places like Iowa, because we can win a Senate seat there.
This is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the Senate and more so that we cannot only balance the Supreme Court, but start to pass an aggressive agenda that, frankly, isn’t so aggressive, because most of America agrees with the policy objectives of our party.
Mayor De Blasio…
Rachel, we have to actually…
Congressman Delaney, you’ll have some time in a moment on this issue.
This issue is related…
Congressman Delaney, I’ll give you some time in a moment.
Mayor De Blasio, as an executive in the largest city in this country, you are used to saying what you want to have happen and having it happen.
If you nominate a Supreme Court nominee as president of the United States and Mitch McConnell is still Senate majority leader, what makes you believe that he would allow you to make a nominee?
Rachel, I am chief executive of the nation’s largest city, and I also wanted to just say something quick on the gun issue and come to your question.
Look, I run the largest police force in America, too, and if we’re going to stop these shootings, we want to get these guns off the street, we have to have a very different relationship between our police and our community.
I also want to say there’s something that sets me apart from all my colleagues running in this race, and that is, for the last 21 years, I have been raising a black son in America.
And I have had to have very, very serious talks with my son, Dante, about how to protect himself on the streets of our city and all over this country, including how to deal with the fact that he has to take special caution because there have been too many tragedies between our young men and our police, too, as we saw recently in Indiana.
So we need to have a different conversation in this country about guns, but also a different conversation about policing that brings policing community together.
We’ve done that in New York City and we’ve driven down crime while we’ve done it.
But to your question about Mitch McConnell, there is a political solution that we have to come to grips with.
If the Democratic Party would stop acting like the party of the elites and be the party of working people again, and go into states, including red states, to convince people we’re on their side, we can put pressure on their senators to actually have to vote for the nominees that are put forward…
Let me say that there is no one in our government at any level who has the right to tell any American who they should be allowed to love or who they should be allowed to marry.
My record in Congress for over six years shows my commitment to fighting for  equality.
I serve on the Equality Caucus and recently voted for passage of the Equality Act.
Maybe many people in this country can relate to the fact that I grew up in a socially conservative home, held views when I was very young that I no longer hold today.
I’ve served with  servicemembers, both in training and deployed downrange.
I know that they would give their life for me and I would give my life for them.
It is this commitment that I’ll carry through as president of the United States, recognizing that there are still people who are facing discrimination in the workplace, still people who are unable to find a home for their families.
It is this kind of discrimination that we need to address.
But it’s not enough.
Thank you, Congresswoman Gabbard.
It’s not enough.
If I can add to this, it’s very important.
Thirty seconds, Senator.
It’s not enough.
Look, civil rights is someplace to begin, but in the African American civil rights community, another place to focus on was to stop the lynching of African-Americans.
We do not talk enough about trans Americans, especially African-American trans Americans… … and the incredibly high rates of murder right now.
We don’t talk enough about how many children, about 30 percent of  kids, who do not go to school because of fear.
It’s not enough just to be on the Equality Act.
I’m an original co-sponsor.
We need to have a president that will fight to protect  Americans every single day from violence in America.
Senator Klobuchar, let me put this to you.
On the issue of civil rights, for decades — on the civil rights and demographics, honestly, and politics, for decades, the Democratic Party has counted on African-American voter turnout as step one to winning elections on a national level.
Democrats are counting on the Latino community now and in the future in the same way.
What have you done for black and Latino voters that should enthuse them about going to the polls for you if you’re your party’s nominee?
My life and my career and my work in the Senate has been about economic opportunity.
And to me, this means better childcare for everyone in this country.
And when you want an economy that works, you need to have retirement that works, you need to have public schools that work.
And you also need to make sure that those communities are able to get those jobs of the future, the STEM jobs.
In fact, Donald Trump, one of the first bills that he signed of the 34 he signed where I was the lead Democrat — OK, that’s a first up here — was one that was about that, making sure minority community members could share in those jobs.
So to me, this is about a few things.
It’s about an African-American woman that goes to a hospital in New Orleans, says her hands are swollen, and then doctor ignores her and her baby dies.
It’s about the fact that African-American women make 61 cents for every dollar a white man makes.
So in short, we need, one — and I will do this in my first 100 days as president — we will work to make sure everyone can vote at this table, everyone can vote in this country…
That’s time, Senator.
… and we will also go to the next step of criminal justice reform.
Senator Booker and I worked on that First Step Act, but we should go to the second step act, which is to help all our communities across our country.
Senator, thank you very much.
Thirty-second follow-up to you, Secretary Castro.
This is a 70 percent Latino city here in Miami.
You are the only Latino Democrat who is running here this year in the presidential race.
Is that enough of an answer, what Senator Klobuchar is describing there, an economic justice agenda?
Is that enough to mobilize Latino voters to stand with the Democratic Party in a big way?
Well, I also think that we have to recognize racial and social justice.
And, you know, I was in Charleston not too long ago, and I remembered that Dylann Roof went to the Mother Emanuel AME church, and he murdered nine people who were worshipping, and then he was apprehended by police without incident.
Well, but what about Eric Garner and Tamir Rice and Laquan McDonald and Sandra Bland and Pamela Turner and Antonio Arce?
I’m proud that I’m the only candidate so far that has put forward legislation that would reform our policing system in America and make sure that no matter what the color of your skin is, that you’re treated the same, including Latinos who are mistreated too oftentimes by police.
John, appreciate the question.
The answer is yes, but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends.
When the United States presents a united front, we have a much better chance of achieving our  aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer, the kind of genocide that we saw in Rwanda, the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward.
But unfortunately, under this administration, President Trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances.
He’s diminished our standing in the world and he’s made us weaker as a country, less able to confront challenges, whether it’s Iran or North Korea or Vladimir Putin in Russia, who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016, and who President Trump has offered another invitation to do the same.
He’s embraced strongmen and dictators at the expense of the great democracies.
As president, I will make sure that we live our values in our .
I will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together.
That makes America stronger.
But what about the War Powers Act?
Congressman O’Rourke, thank you.
What about the War Powers Act being a part of that equation?
With deep respect to the congressman, look, we’ve learned painful lessons as Americans that we’ve gone to war without congressional authorization.
And look, this is very personal for me.
I know the cost of war.
My dad served in the Pacific in World War II in the U.S. Army, Battle of Okinawa, had half his leg blown off, and he came home with scars, both physical and emotional, and he did not recover.
He spiraled downward and he ultimately took his own life.
And that battle didn’t kill him, but that war did.
And, look, even in the humanitarian crisis — and I think we should be ready, Congressman, to intervene, God forbid there is genocide — but not without congressional approval.
Democrats and Republicans both in the Congress have not challenged presidents and have let them get away with running the military without that congressional approval.
We learned a lesson in Vietnam we seem to have forgotten, that decisions have to be made by the United States Congress…
I’m going to pick up — I want to pick up this point, and I want to put this to Congressman Ryan.
Today the Taliban claimed responsibility for killing two American servicemembers in Afghanistan.
Leaders as disparate as President Obama and President Trump have both said that they want to end U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, but it isn’t over for America.
Why isn’t it over?
Why can’t presidents of very different parties and very different temperaments get us out of there?
And how could you?
I appreciate that question.
So I’ve been in Congress 17 years.
And 12 of those years I’ve sat on the Armed Services Committee, the Defense Appropriations Committee or the Armed Services Committee.
And the lesson that I’ve learned over the years is that you have to stay engaged in these situations.
Nobody likes it.
It’s long.
It’s tedious.
But right now, we have — so I would say we must be engaged in this.
We must have our State Department engaged.
We must have our military engaged to the extent they need to be.
But the reality of it is, this president doesn’t even have people appointed in the State Department to deal with these things, whether we’re talking about Central America, whether we’re talking about Iran, whether we’re talking about Afghanistan.
We’ve got to be completely engaged.
And here’s why, because these flare-ups distract us from the real problems in the country.
If we’re getting drones shot down for $130 million, because the president is distracted, that’s $130 million that we could be spending in places like Youngstown, Ohio, or Flint, Michigan, or rebuilding — or rebuilding…
Congresswoman Gabbard, I’m going to give you 30 seconds, actually, to jump off what he said.
He described engagement as the problem.
Is that what you will tell — is that what you will tell the parents of those two soldiers who were just killed in Afghanistan?
Well, we just have to be engaged?
As a soldier, I will tell you, that answer is unacceptable.
We have to bring our troops home from Afghanistan.
We are in a place in Afghanistan where we have lost so many lives.
We’ve spent so much money.
Money that’s coming out of every one of our pockets, money that should be going into communities here at home, meeting the needs of the people here at home.
We are no better off in Afghanistan today than we were when this war began.
This is why it’s so important to have a president and commander-in-chief who knows the cost of war and who’s ready to do the job on day one.
I am ready to do that job when I walk into the Oval Office.
Listen, I’m going to go down the line — I’m going to go down — I’m going to go down — I’m going to go down the line here.
You know what, you felt — you felt like she was rebutting you.
Get 30 seconds, go.
Thank you.
You’re a very good man.
I appreciate that.
Fair enough.
I hear what you’re saying.
She invoked your name.
I would just say, I don’t want to be engaged.
I wish we were spending this money in places that I’ve represented that have been completely forgotten and we were rebuilding.
But the reality of it is, if the United States isn’t engaged, the Taliban will grow.
And they will have bigger, bolder terrorist acts.
We have got to have some presence there…
The Taliban was there long before we came in.
They’re going to be there long before we leave.
And they were — yeah, exactly.
Well, we were.
We cannot keep U.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan thinking that we’re going to somehow squash this Taliban that’s been there, that every other country that’s tried has failed.
I didn’t say — I didn’t say squash them.
I didn’t say squash them.
When we weren’t in there, they started flying planes into our buildings.
So I’m just saying right now … we have an obligation…
The Taliban didn’t attack us on 9/11.
Al Qaida did.
Well, I — I understand…
Al Qaida attacked us on 9/11.
That’s why I and so many other people joined the military, to go after Al Qaida, not the Taliban.
I understand that.
The Taliban…
Go ahead, Congressman.
Finish up, 10 seconds.
The Taliban was protecting those people who were plotting against us.
All I’m saying is, if we want to go into elections, and we want to say that we’ve got to withdraw from the world, that’s what President Trump is saying.
We can’t.
I would love for us to.
Well, you are quite right.
We have a new vision for America and at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America, while 500,000 people are sleeping out on the streets today we think it is time for change, real change.
And by that I mean that healthcare in my view is a human right and we have got to pass a Medicare for all single-payer system.
Under that system by the way vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now.
I believe that education is the future for this country and that is why I believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition-free and eliminate student debt and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street.
Every proposal that I have brought forth is fully paid for.
Senator Sanders I will give you 10 seconds just to ask the–answer the very direct question will you raise taxes for the middle class in a Sanders administration?
People who have healthcare under Medicare for all will have no premiums, no deductibles, no copayments, no out of expe–out-of-pocket expenses.
Yes, they will pay more in taxes but less in healthcare for what they get.
Thank you Senator.
Senator Sanders–
Senator–Senator Bennet we’re going to get to everybody.
What I meant by that is look, Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America.
Ordinary middle-class Americans built America.
My dad used to have an expression he said Joe a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it’s about your dignity, it’s about respect, it’s being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything’s going to be okay.
Too many people who are in the middle class and poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal.
What I am saying is that we’ve got to be straightforward.
We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it.
They have to make sure that we (INAUDIBLE) situation where there’s continuing education and they are able to pay for it and they have to make sure that they are able to breathe air that is–is–is clean and they–they have water that they can drink.
Look, Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation.
We do have enormous income inequality and one thing I agree honestly can make massive cuts in the $1.6 trillion in tax loopholes out there and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy.
Well, I think that the bottom line is, if we don’t clearly define that we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way they can and–and call us socialists.
And if you look at the Green New Deal, which I admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change, I’m a scientist, but we can’t promise every American a government job if you want to get universal healthcare coverage.
I believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege, but you can’t expect to eliminate private insurance for 180 million people, many of whom don’t want to give it up.
In Colorado, we brought businesses and nonprofits together.
We got to near universal healthcare coverage.
We were the first state in America to–to bring the environmental community and the oil and gas industry to address, aggressively address methane emissions.
And we were also the first place to–to expand reproductive rights on a scale basis that we reduced teen pregnancy by 54 percent.
We’ve done the big progressive things people said it couldn’t be done.
I’ve done what pretty much everyone else up here is still talking about doing.
Governor, thank you.
Senator Sanders–I’ll give you a chance to–to weigh in here.
What is your response to those who say nominating a–a socialist would reelect Donald Trump?
Well, I think the responses at the polls, last poll I saw had us 10 points ahead of Donald Trump, because the American people understand that Trump is a phony, that Trump is a pathological liar and a racist, and then he lied to the American people during his campaign.
He said he was going to stand up for working families.
Well, President Trump, you’re not standing up for working families when you try to throw 32 million people off the healthcare that they have and that 83 percent of your tax benefits go to the top 1 percent.
That’s how we be Trump.
We expose him for the fraud that he is.
In answer–
–Senator–
–I want to talk about–
–Senator Gillibrand, 30 seconds.
I disagree with both their perspectives.
The debate we’re having in our party right now is confusing because the truth is there’s a big difference between capitalism on the one hand and greed on the other.
And so, all the things that we’re trying to change is when companies care more about profits when they do about people.
So, if you’re talking about ending gun violence, it’s the greed of the NRA and the gun manufacturers that make any progress impossible.
It’s the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies when we want to try to get healthcare as a right and not a privilege.
Senator Gillibrand–
–So, there may–
–Thank you–
–Not be disagreement in the party because, in truth, we want healthy capitalism.
Senator, thank you.
We don’t want corrupted capitalism–
–Thank you.
I want to be fair to all the candidates–
–Which is the definition of greed.
Thank you.
Senator Bennet–You have said, “It’s possible to write policy proposals that have no basis in reality.
You might as well call them candy.” Were you referring to any candidate or proposal in particular when you said that?
Are you–was that directed to me?
Yes, that was your quote.
Well, thank you.
That sounded like me.
Thank you.
It was you.
I appreciate it.
Well–
–It definitely wasn’t me–
–Look, first of all, I agree completely with Bernie about what the fundamental challenge we’re facing as a country is, 40 years of no economic growth for 90 percent of the American people.
One hundred and sixty thousand families in the top .1 percent have the same wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and we got the worst income inequality that we’ve had in 100 years.
Where I disagree is on his solution on Medicare for All.
You know, I–I have proposed getting to universal healthcare, which we need to do.
It is a right.
Healthcare is a right.
We need to get to personal healthcare.
I believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with Obamacare and creating a public option that every family and every person in America can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option which for them would be like having Medicare for all or whether they want to keep their private insurance.
I believe we will get there much more quickly if we do that.
If I could just finish–Bernie mentioned that the taxes that we would have to pay because of those taxes Vermont rejected Medicare for all.
In Bernie’s bill, in Bernie’s bill I wrote–
We are going to talk about healthcare at length Senator, but at the moment my colleague–
In Senator Sanders’ bill I wrote the part in Senator Sanders’ bill that is the transition that merges what the two senators said.
Senator.
The truth is if you have a buy in over a four or five year period you move us to single payer more quickly.
Senator, we will get to this.
We will get to this.
I got $100,000 in student loan debt myself.
I tell you–if I count on the people who have been in government for the past 30 years who were around when this problem was created to be the ones to solve it it is going to be the next generation, the 40 million of us who can’t start a family.
Can’t take a good idea and start a business and can’t buy our first home.
This is the generation that’s going to be able to solve student loan debt.
This generation is ready to lead.
Mr.–Mr. Yang your signature policy is to give every adult in the United States $1,000 a month no questions asked.
That’s right.
I think that’s like $3.2 trillion a–a year.
How would you do that?
I’m sorry?
Oh, so it’s difficult to do if you have companies like Amazon, trillion dollar tech companies paying literally 0 in taxes while they’re closing 30 percent of our stores.
Now, we need to put the American people in a position to benefit from all of these innovations in other parts of the economy.
And if we had a value added tax at even half the European level it would generate over 800 billion in new revenue which combined with the money in our hands it would be the trickle up economy from our people, families and communities up we would spend the money and circulate through our regional economies and neighborhoods–creating millions of jobs, making our families stronger and healthier.
We’d save money on things like incarceration, homelessness services, emergency room healthcare and just the value gains from having a stronger, healthier, mentally healthier population would increase GDP by $700 billion.
This is the move we have to make particularly as technology is now automating away millions of American’s jobs, why Donald Trump is our president today that we automated away 400 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and we’re about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs, call center jobs, fast food jobs, truck driving jobs on and on throughout the economy.
So, I get to understand you a little better.
So, you’re saying $1,000 a month for everyone over 18 but a value added tax so you can spend that $1000 on value added tax?
Well, the value added tax what it would end up–you would still be increasing the buying power of the bottom 94 percent of Americans.
You have to spend a lot of money for a mild value add tax to eat up $12,000 a year per individual.
So for the average family with two or three adults it would $24 to $36,000 a year.
OK.
So, Congressman Swalwell, want to talk a little bit about what Mr. Yang is talking about and you just actually mentioned it–many Americans are worried about things like self-driving cars, robots, drones, artificial intelligence will cost them their jobs.
What would you to help people get the skills they need to adapt to this new world?
We must always be a country where technology creates more jobs than–
–Displaces.
And I’ve seen the anxiety across America where the manufacturing floors go from 1,000 to 100 to one.
So, we have to modernize our schools, value the teachers who prepare our kids, wipe the student debt from any teacher that goes into a community that needs it.
Invest in America’s communities, especially where places where the best exports are people who move away to get skills.
But, Jose, I was six years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic Convention and said, it’s time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans.
That candidate was then Senator Joe Biden.
Joe Biden was right when he said it was time the pass the torch to a new generation of Americans 32 years ago.
He’s still right today.
If we’re going to solve the issues of automation (PH), pass the torch.
If we’re going to solve the issues of climate chaos, pass the torch.
If we’re going to solve the issue of student loan debt, pass the torch.
If we’re going to end gun violence for families who are fearful of sending their kids to school, pass the torch.
Vice president, would you like to sing a torch song?
I would.
I’m still holding on to that torch.
I want to make it clear to you, look, the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on to educate for an education.
The fact is that that’s why I propose us focusing on schools that are in distress.
That’s why I think we should triple the amount of money we spend for Title I schools.
That’s why I think we should have universal Pre-K.
That’s why I think every single person who graduates from high school–65 out of 100 now need something beyond high school and we should provide for them to be able to get that education.
That’s why there should be free community college, cutting in half the cost of college.
That’s why we should be in the position where we do not have anyone have to pay back the student debt when they get out, they’re making less than $25,000 a year.
Their debt is frozen.
No interest payment until they get beyond that.
We can’t put people in a position where they aren’t able to go on and move on.
And so, folks, there’s a lot we can do, but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the 21st century.
We’re not doing that now.
Senator.
Senator.
As the youngest–as the youngest guy on the stage, I feel like I probably ought to contribute to the generation.
Before–before–
As part of Joe’s generation–
–I’m for–
–I’m all for–
–Before we move on–
–As part of Joe’s generation–
Before–before we move–
–Let me respond–the issue, if I may say–
–Before we move on from education–
–Is not generational–
–Let’s please–please.
Yeah.
Senators.
Senators.
Yeah.
We forgive (CROSSTALK).
–The issue is who has the guts–
(INAUDIBLE) comment–
–To take on Wall Street, to take on the fossil fuel industry, to take on the big money interest who have unbelievable influence over the economic and political life of this country.
These issues (INAUDIBLE).
That’s the issue.
Senator Harris.
Senator Harris.
Senator Harris, I’m so sorry.
Can I have a turn?
We will let all of these things.
Senator Harris.
We will let you all speak.
Senator Harris.
been part of the issue–
Hey, guys.
You know what?
America does not want to witness a food fight.
They want to know how we’re going to put food on their table.
So, on that point, part of the issue that is at play in America today, and we’ve all been traveling around the country, I certainly have, I’m meeting people who are working two and three jobs.
You know, this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy, right?
My great economy.
My great economy.
You ask him, well, how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours and he talks about the stock market.
Well, that’s fine if you own stocks.
So many families in America do not.
You ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers.
Well, yeah, people in America are working.
They’re working two and three jobs.
So, when we talk about jobs, let’s be very clear.
In our America, no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table.
Thank you very much, senator.
Yes.
You have all–you’ve all expressed an interest in talking about healthcare.
So, let’s–
Well, I just want to agree that I think Russia is our biggest geopolitical threat because they’ve been hacking our democracy successfully.
They’ve been laughing their asses off about it for the last couple of years and we should focus on that before we start worrying about other threats.
Now, China, they do–they do (INAUDIBLE) property.
It’s a massive problem.
But the tariffs and the trade war are just punishing businesses and producers and workers on both sides.
I met with a farmer in Iowa who said he spent six years building up a buying relationship in China that’s now disappeared and gone forever.
And the beneficiaries have not been American workers or–or people in China.
It’s been Southeast Asia and other producers that have then stepped into the void.
So, we need to–to crack down on Chinese malfeasance in the trade relationship but the tariffs and the trade war are the wrong way to go.
how would you stand up against China?
Yeah, I mean first of all, we’ve got to recognize that the China challenge really is a serious one.
This is not something to dismiss or wave away.
And if you look at what China is doing.
They’re using technology for the perfection of dictatorship.
But, their fundamental economic model isn’t gonna change because of some tariffs.
I live in the industrial Midwest.
Folks who aren’t in the shadow of a factory or somewhere near a soy field where I live.
And manufacturers, and especially soy farmers, are hurting.
Tariffs are taxes.
And Americans are gonna pay on average $800 more a year because of these tariffs.
Meanwhile, China is investing so that they could soon be able to run circles around us in artificial intelligence.
And this president is fixated on the China relationship as if all that mattered was the export balance on dishwashers.
We’ve got a much bigger issue on our hands.
But in a moment when their authoritarian model is being held up as an alternative to ours because ours looks so chaotic compared to theirs right now because of our internal divisions.
The biggest thing we’ve got to do is invest in our own domestic competitiveness.
If we disinvest–
–All right, mayor, thank you.
–In our own infrastructure, education we are never gonna be able to compete.
And if we really want to be an alternative, a democratic alternative, we actually have to demonstrate that we care about democratic values–
–Mayor, thank you, thank you for your answer.
–At home.
Because I couldn’t get it done.
My community is in anguish right now because of an officer involved shooting.
A black man Eric Logan killed by a white officer.
And I’m not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back.
The officer says he was attacked with a knife, but he didn’t have his body camera on.
It’s a mess.
And we’re hurting.
And I could walk you through all of the things that we have done as a community–all of the steps that we took from bias training to de-escalation but it didn’t save the life of Eric Logan.
And when I look into his mother’s eyes I have to face the fact and nothing that I say will bring him back.
This is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country.
And until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism whatever this particular incident teaches us we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that there is a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time.
Not just from what has happened in the past but what’s happening around the country in the present.
It threatens the well being of every community.
And I am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle when they see a police officer approaching feels the exact same thing.
A feeling not of fear but of safety.
I’m determined to bring that day about.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Mayor Buttigieg, Mayor Buttigieg, if I could ask one question because I think–
Governor, I’ll give you 30 seconds.
I think that the question they are asking in South Bend I think across the country is why is it taking so long?
We had a shooting when I first became mayor 10 years before Ferguson and the community came together and we created an office of the independent monitor–civilian oversight commission.
We diversified the police force in two years.
We actually did de-escalation training.
I think the real question that America should be asking is why five years after Ferguson every city doesn’t have this level of police accountability?
Governor Hickenlooper, thank you.
We–
I’ve got to respond to that.
Look, we’ve taken so many steps toward police accountability that the FOP just denounced me for too much accountability.
We’re obviously not there yet.
And I accept responsibility for that–
(INAUDIBLE) you should fire the chief.
So, under Indiana law this will be investigated.
And there will be accountability for the officer involved.
But you’re the mayor.
You should fire the chief if that’s the policy and someone died.
All of these issues are extremely important but there are specifics, there are symptoms.
And the underlying cause has to do with deep, deep, deep realms of racial injustice.
Both in our criminal justice system and in our economic system.
And the democratic party should be on the side of reparations for slavery for this very reason.
I do not believe–I do not believe that the average American is a racist.
But the average American is woefully undereducated about the history of race in the United States.
Vice President Biden, we’re going to get to you.
Hang on.
We’re going to get–
I would like to say–
–Ms. Williamson, thank you very much.
No, absolutely not.
Unlike the Republican party we encourage diverse city, we believe in diverse city, that is what America is up about.
But in addition to diversity in terms of having more women, more people from the GB–L–LGBT community we also have to do something else and that is we have to ask ourselves a simple question and that how come to day the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1 percent has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth.
We need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interest who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.
Senator Gillibrand I want to give you 30 seconds on this.
Well, first of all where Bernie left off we have heard a lot of good ideas on this stage tonight and a lot of plans but the truth is until you go to the root of the corruption, the money in the–in politics, the fact that Washington is run by these special interest you are never going to solve any of these problems.
I have the most comprehensive approach that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption to get money out of politics through publicly funded elections, to have clean elections.
If we do that and get money out of politics we can guarantee healthcare as a right not a privilege we can deal with institutional racism, we can’t take on income inequality and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs Washington.
Gridlock will not magically disappear as long as Mitch McConnell is there, first.
Second, second, that is why it is so important for us to when not just the presidency to have somebody that can run in all 50 states but to–but to win the Senate as well and that is why we have to propose policies that can be supported like Medicare X (PH) so that we can build a broad coalition of Americans to overcome broken Washington DC.
I agree with what Senator Gillibrand was saying and share a lot of her views.
We need to in gerrymandering in wash–and we need to end political gerrymandering in Washington.
The court today said they couldn’t do anything about it.
We need to overturn Citizens United.
The court was the one that gave us Citizens United.
And the attack on voting rights in Shelby versus Holder is something we need to deal with.
All of those things has happened since Vice President Biden was in the Senate.
And we face structural problems that we have to overcome with a broad coalition.
It’s the only way we can do it.
We need to root out the corruption in Washington, expand people’s right to get to the polls.
Time is up.
Thank you.
And I think then we can succeed.
Vice President Biden–
–Can I respond–
–Thirty seconds.
I want–I–what–it does sound as if you haven’t seen what’s been happening in the United States Senate over the last 12 years.
It didn’t happen.
Why?
I have seen what happened just sense we were vice president.
We needed three votes to pass an $800 billion recovery act that kept us from going into depression.
I got three votes changed.
We needed to be able to keep the government from shutting down and going bankrupt.
I got Mitch McConnell to raise taxes $600 billion by raising the top rate.
And as recently as after the President got elected, I was able to put together a coalition on the Cures Act that billions of dollars go into cancer research, bipartisan.
But sometimes you can’t do that.
Sometimes you just have to go out and beat them.
I went into 20 states, over 60 candidates–
–Okay, thank you–
–And guess what?
We beat them.
We won back the Senate.
Chuck?
Chuck?
Thank you.
Chuck–
–Thank you, Mr.–
–The problem with what the vice–
–Go ahead, 30 seconds–
–No. What?
Yeah, 30 seconds.
Go ahead.
We–sometimes you do have to beat them, but–but the deal that he talked about with Mitch McConnell was a complete victory for the Tea Party.
It extended the Bush tax cuts permanently.
The Democratic Party had been running against that for 10 years.
We’ve lost that economic argument because that deal extended almost all those Bush tax cuts permanently and put in place the mindless cuts that we still are dealing with today that are called the sequester.
That was a great deal for Mitch McConnell.
Oh, come on.
It was a terrible deal for America.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Bennet.
And you heard from Republicans.
Right, right.
You heard from the Republicans–
–Go ahead, 30 seconds–
–That the reason why the Trump tax cut had to be passed is because they had to pay back their donors.
You heard it.
They actually said those words.
So, the corruption in Washington is real, and it is something that makes every one of the plans we’ve heard about over the last several months impossible.
And I have the most comprehensive approach to do it with clean elections, publicly funded elections so we restore the power of our democracy into the hands of the voters, not into the Koch brothers.
We were talking about issues.
Imagine–we’re in Florida.
Imagine the Parkland kids having as much power in our democracy–
–Thank you–
–As the Koch brothers or the NRA.
Thank you, Senator Gillibrand.
Thank you.
Imagine their voices carrying–Farther and wider than–
–Thank you–
–Anyone else because their voice is needed.
Go ahead.
Senator Gillibrand, I’m trying–
–And you can–and as president–
–To get everyone in here–
–It’s the first thing I’m going–
–Thank you–
–To do because nothing else is possible, whether it’s education or healthcare or ending institutional racism.
Well, my plan is somebody who believes, for a start, that a woman’s right to control her own body is a constitutional right, that government and politicians should not infringe on that right.
We will do everything we can to defense our–Roe versus Wade.
Second of all, let me make– –Let me make–let me make a promise here.
You asked about litmus test.
My litmus test is I will never appoint any–nominate any justice to the Supreme Court unless that justice is 100 percent clear he or she will defend Roe v.
Wade.
Third of all, I do not believe in packing the court.
right now.
But I do believe that constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts.
And that brings in new blood into the supreme court and a majority I hope that will understand that a woman has the right to control her own body and that corporations cannot run the United States of America.
Senator
I’m going to give you 10 additional seconds because (INAUDIBLE) what if the court has already overturned Roe and Roe is gone?
All of the things you have described would be to try to preserve Roe.
If Roe was gone what could you do as president to preserve abortion rights?
Well, first of all let me tell you this–didn’t come up yet but let’s face this–Medicare for All guarantees every woman in this country the right to have an abortion if she wants it.
Thank you, Senator.
And can I just address this for a second?
And I–and I want to talk directly-directly to America’s women and to men who love them–women’s reproductive rights are under assault by President Trump and the Republican party.
Thirty states are trying to overturn Roe v.
Wade right now.
And it is mind boggling to me that we are debating this on this stage in 2019 among democrats whether women should have access to reproductive rights.
I think we have to stop playing defense and start playing offense.
But let me tell you one thing about politics because it goes to the corruption of the deal making–when the door is closed negotiations are made.
There are conversations about women’s rights and compromises have been made behind our backs.
That’s how we got to Hyde.
That’s how the Hyde Amendment was created.
A compromise by leaders of both parties.
Then we have the ACA.
During the ACA neg–negotiations I had to fight like heck with other women to make sure that contraception wasn’t sold down the river or abortion services.
And so, what we need to know is imagine this one question–when we beat President Trump and Mitch McConnell walks into the Oval Office god forbid to do negotiations who do you want when that door closes to be sitting behind that desk to fight for women’s rights?
I have been the fiercest advocate for women’s reproductive freedom for over a decade.
Thank you.
And I promise you as President–
Senator–
–when that door closes I will guarantee women’s reproductive (INAUDIBLE) no matter what.
Well, first of all I don’t even call it climate change.
It’s a climate crisis.
It represents an existential threat to us as a species.
And the fact that we have a President of the United States who has embraced science fiction over science fact will be to our collective peril.
I visited while the embers were smoldering the wildfires in California I spoke with firefighters who were in the midst of fighting a fire while their own homes were burning.
And on this issue it is a–it is a critical issue that is about what we must do to confront what is immediate and before us right now.
That is why I support a Green New Deal.
It is why I believe on day one and as President will re-enter us in the Paris agreement because we have to take these issues seriously and frankly, we have a President of the United States we talked about you asked before what is the greatest national security threat to the United States?
It’s Donald Trump.
And I’m going to tell you why.
And I’m going to tell you why because I agree climate change represents an existential threat.
He denies the science.
You want to talk about North Korea, real threat in terms of nuclear arsenal but what doe she do?
He embraces Kim Jong Un a dictator
History where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people.
I have supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran for (INAUDIBLE).
Vice President Biden 30 seconds because I want to bring other people into this.
I–I supported the ERA from the very beginning.
I am the guy that extended the voting rights act for 25 years.
We got to the place where we got 98 out of 98 votes in the United States Senate doing it.
I have also argued very strongly that we in fact deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box.
I agree that everybody once they in fact–my time is up.
I’m sorry.
Thank you vice president.
All of these things (INAUDIBLE).
Senator Sanders–Senator Sanders, I want to go to you on this.
You said on the day you launched your campaign that voters should focus on what people stand for, not a candidate’s race or age or sexual orientation.
Any Democrats are very excited by the diversity of this field on this stage and on last night stage and the perspective that diverse city brings to this contest and to these issues.
Are you telling Democratic voters that diverse city should it matter when they make this decision?
No, absolutely not.
Unlike the Republican party we encourage diverse city, we believe in diverse city, that is what America is up about.
But in addition to diversity in terms of having more women, more people from the GB–L–LGBT community we also have to do something else and that is we have to ask ourselves a simple question and that how come to day the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1 percent has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth.
We need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interest who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.
Senator Gillibrand I want to give you 30 seconds on this.
Well, first of all where Bernie left off we have heard a lot of good ideas on this stage tonight and a lot of plans but the truth is until you go to the root of the corruption, the money in the–in politics, the fact that Washington is run by these special interest you are never going to solve any of these problems.
I have the most comprehensive approach that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption to get money out of politics through publicly funded elections, to have clean elections.
If we do that and get money out of politics we can guarantee healthcare as a right not a privilege we can deal with institutional racism, we can’t take on income inequality and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs Washington.
Gridlock will not magically disappear as long as Mitch McConnell is there, first.
Second, second, that is why it is so important for us to when not just the presidency to have somebody that can run in all 50 states but to–but to win the Senate as well and that is why we have to propose policies that can be supported like Medicare X so that we can build a broad coalition of Americans to overcome broken Washington DC.
I agree with what Senator Gillibrand was saying and share a lot of her views.
We need to in gerrymandering in wash–and we need to end political gerrymandering in Washington.
And new science and technology to be the exporter not only of the green economy, but economy that can create millions of jobs.
But, I would immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord.
I would up the ante in that accord, which it calls for because we make up 15 percent of the problem; 85 percent of the world makes up the rest.
And so, we have to have someone who knows how to corral the rest of the world, bring them together, and get something done like we did in our administrator.
Senators–senators, I want–to give you 30 seconds–
–Look–
–To follow up, but I’m going to hold you to 30 seconds.
Look, the old ways are no longer relevant.
The scientists tell us we have 12 years because there’s irreparable damage to this planet.
This is a global issue.
What the president of the United States should do is not deny the reality of climate change, but tell the rest of the world that instead of spending $1.5 trillion on weapons of destruction, let us get together for the common enemy and that is to transform the world energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency, and sustainable energy.
Thank you.
The future of the planet rests on us doing that.
There–there’s–
–Before we go–
–There’s–
–Hang on.
Before we leave this topic–
–Here’s a solution.
Pass the torch.
Pass the torch to the generation that’s going to feel the effects–
–No–
–Of climate change–take on the fossil fuel–
–Pass the torch to the generation–
–Is (CROSSTALK) the solution–
–That’s inventive enough–
–Agreed.
And–
–Before we leave this topic–here’s something you all want to weigh in on.
Hold on a moment.
Just–just–
–Campaign to the Republican Party.
Hold on moment.
Just trust us on this.
And the fact–
Keep your pistols, keep your rifles, keep your shotguns but we can take the most dangerous weapons from the most dangerous people.
We have the NRA on the ropes because of the Moms because the Brady Group, because of Giffords, because of March for Our Lives.
But I’m the only candidate on this stage calling for a ban and buyback of every single assault weapon in America.
I’ve seen the plans of the other candidates here.
They would all leave 15 million assault in our communities.
They wouldn’t do a single thing to save a single life in Parkland.
I will approach this issue as a prosecutor.
I will approach it as the only person on this stage who has voted and passed background checks–but also as a parent of a generation who sends our children to school where we look at what they’re wearing so we can remember it in case we have to identify them later.
A generation who has seen thousands of black children killed in our streets and a generation who goes to the theater and we actually where the fire exits are.
We don’t have to live this way.
We must be a country who loves our children more than we love our guns.
Senator Sanders a Vermont newspaper recently released portions of an interview you gave in 2013 in which you said, “My own view on guns is everything being equal, states should make those decisions.
No.
Has your thinking changed since then?
Do you now think there’s a federal role to play?
Mischaracterization of my thinking.
Look–
It’s a quote of you.
We have a gun–we have a gun crisis right now.
40,000 people a year are getting killed.
In 1988, Rachel, when it wasn’t popular I ran on a platform of banning assault weapons and in fact, lost that race for Congress.
I have a D minus voting record from the NRA.
And I believe that what we need is comprehensive gun–gun legislation that, among other things, provides universal background.
We end the gun show loophole.
We end the straw man provision.
And I believed in 1988 and I believe today that assault weapons–
–Why would you–why would you leave 15 million on the streets–
–Assault weapons–assault weapons–
–Why would you leave–Senator–
–Are weapons–
–You leave 15 million on the streets–
–Are from the military–
–Though–
–And that they should not be on the streets–
–Why do you leave–
–Of America.
You would–your plan leaves them on the streets.
You leave 15 million on the streets.
We ban the sale and–we ban the sale and distribution–
–Will you buy them back–
–And that’s what I’ve believed for many years.
Will you–will you buy them back?
And then–and–and–
–If people want to buy–if the government wants to do that, if people want bring it back–
–But you’re going to be the government–
–Yes–
–Will you buy them back?
Yeah.
Senator Harris, we’re going to give you 30 seconds here.
Thank you.
I think your idea is a great one, Congressman Swalwell.
And I will say there are a lot of great idea.
The problem is Congress has not had the courage to act, which is why, when elected president of the United States, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to pull their act together, bring all these good ideas together, and put a bill on my desk for signature.
And if they do not, I will take executive action and I will put in place–The most comprehensive background check policy we’ve had.
I will require the ATF to take the licenses of gun dealers who violate the law.
And I will banned by executive order the importation of assault weapons, because I’m going to tell you, as a prosecutor, I have seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you.
I have hugged more mothers who are the mothers of homicide victims, and I have attended more police officer funerals.
It is enough.
It is enough.
And there have been plenty of good ideas from members of the United States Congress.
There’s been no action.
As president, I will take action.
Mayor Buttigieg–I want to bring you in on this, sir; a lot of discussion about assault rifles that are often as shorthanded as military style weapons.
You are the only person on the stage tonight with military experience as a veteran of the Afghanistan war.
Will military families–does that inform your thinking on this view?
Do you believe that military families or America’s veterans will, at large, have a different take on this than the other Americans who we’ve been talking about and who Congressman Swalwell is appealing to with his buyback program?
Yeah, of course, because we trained on some of these kinds of weapons.
Look, every part of my life experience informs this, being the mayor of a city where the worst part of the job is dealing with violence.
We–we lose a–as many as were lost at Parkland every two or three years in my city alone.
And this is tearing communities apart.
If more guns made us safer, we be the safest country on earth.
It doesn’t work that way.
And commonsense measures like universal background checks can’t seem to get delivered by Washington, even when most Republicans, let alone most Americans, agree it’s the right thing to do.
And as somebody who trained on weapons of war, I can tell you that there are weapons that have absolutely no place in American cities or neighborhoods in peacetime, ever.
Vice President Biden, 30 seconds.
A real 30 seconds?
A real 30 seconds.
Okay.
I’m the only person that’s beaten the NRA nationally.
I’m the guy that got the Brady Bill passed, the background checks, number one.
Number two, we increased that background check when–when–during the Obama-Biden administration.
I’m also the only guy that got assault weapons banned, banned, and the number of clips in a gun banned.
And so, folks, look, and I would buy back those weapons.
We already started talking about that.
We tried to get it done.
I think it can be done.
And it should be demanded that we do it, and that’s a good expenditure of money.
And lastly, we should have smart guns.
No gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger.
It’s within our right to do that.
We can do that.
Our enemy is the gun manufacturers, not the NRA, the gun manufacturers.
Mr. Vice President, thank you.
But the NRA is taking orders from–
–All right–
–The gun manufacturers.
That’s the problem.
Lester Holt has our next question.
Lester, take it away.
All right, Chuck.
This is a question from our viewers.
We put some suggestions that asked maybe they could share some of.
Here’s one that came from Kathleen (PH) from Canby, Oregon, who writes many fear the current administration has inflicted irrevocable harm on our governing institutions and norms and, in the process, on our reputation abroad.
The question is what do you see as importance early steps in reversing the damage done?
And will put this one to Senator Bennet.
Thank you very much.
What an excellent question.
First of all, we have to restore our democracy at home.
The rest of the world is looking for us for leadership.
We have a president who doesn’t believe in the role of law.
He doesn’t believe in freedom of the press.
He doesn’t believe in an independent judiciary.
He believes in the corruption that he’s brought to Washington D.C. And that is what we have to change.
And that’s why everybody is up here tonight.
And I appreciate the fact that there up here for that reason.
Second, we’ve got to–we’ve got to restore the relationships that he’s destroyed with our allies, not just in Europe.
He flew to the G20 last night and attacked Japan, Germany, and a third ally of ours without saying anything about North Korea or Russia.
And when you’ve got a situation where you have a president who says something happens in the Straits of Hormuz and the whole world doesn’t know whether to believe it or not, that is a huge problem when it comes to the national security of the United States of America.
This is a perfect time–
–And we need to change that.
Well, one of my first phone calls would be to call the European leaders and say we are back because I totally understand how important it is that the United States be part of the Western alliance.
Okay.
I want–I’m trying to get one–one or two words here.
I–guy here you.
Governor Hickenlooper?
You know I talk about constant engagement and I think the first–the first country I would go to but I understand they have been cheating and stealing intellectual property would be China because–
Okay.
–because if we are going to do deal with–deal with public health pandemics and we are going to deal with–
Thank you.
–all of the challenges of the globe we’ve got to have relationships with everyone.
Mr. Yang, we will try to squeeze in a couple of more things before we go to another break.
Mr. Yang?
China, we need to cooperate with them on climate change, AI, and other issues, North Korea.
Thanks for the quickness.
Mayor Buttigieg?
We have no idea which of our most important allies he will have pissed off between now and then.
What we know is that our relationship–with the entire world needs to change.
And it starts by modeling American values at home.
Okay.
Mr. Vice President, we are trying to be quick.
We know NATO will fall apart if he is elected for more years it is the single most consequential alliance–
Okay.
–in the history of the United States.
Senator Sanders?
It’s not one country.
I think it is rebuilding trust in the United Nations and understand that we can solve conflicts without war but with diplomacy.
Senator Harris?
All of the members of the NATO alliance.
Senator Gillibrand?
President Trump is hell-bent on starting a war with Iran.
My first act will be to engage Iran to stabilize the Middle East and make sure we do not start an unwanted never-ending war.
Senator Bennet quickly.
Our European allies and every Latin American country that is willing to have a conversation about how to deal with the refugee crisis.
And Congressman Swalwell?
Because once we–once Bush abuse that power what happened was we got elected after that.
I made sure the president turned to me and said Joe, get our combat troops out of Iraq.
I was responsible for getting 150,000 combat troops out of Iraq and my son was one of them.
I also think we should not have combat troops in Afghanistan.
It’s long overdue.
It should end.
And I thirdly I believe that you are not going to find anybody who has pulled together more of our alliances to deal with what is the real stateless threat out there.
We cannot go it alone in terms of dealing with terrorism.
So I would eliminate the–the act that allowed us to go into war and not the AU and fan make sure that it could only be used for what it’s intended–what its intent was and that is to go after terrorist but never do it alone.
That is why we have to repair our alliances.
We put together 65 countries to make sure we dealt with ISIS in Iraq and other places.
That is what I would do.
That is what I have done and I know how to do it.
Senator Sanders, 30 seconds.
One of the differences–one of the differences that Joe and I have in our record is Joe voted for that work, I helped lead the opposition to that or which was a total disaster.
Second of all, I helped lead the effort for the first time to utilize the War Powers Act to get the United States out of these Saudi led intervention in Yemen which is the most horrific humanitarian disaster on Earth.
And thirdly let me be very clear, I will do everything I can to prevent a war with Iran which would be far worse than disastrous war with Iraq.
Senator Sanders thank you.
All right, guys.
Informed consent of the American people.
Good news is you get more time to talk but I have to sneak in one more break.
–right back.
