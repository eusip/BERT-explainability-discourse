0	So I think of it this way.
0	Who is this economy really working for?
0	It’s doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top.
0	It’s doing great for giant drug companies.
0	It’s just not doing great for people who are trying to get a prescription filled.
0	It’s doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons, just not for the African-Americans and Latinos whose families are torn apart, whose lives are destroyed, and whose communities are ruined.
0	It’s doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us.
0	When you’ve got a government, when you’ve got an economy that does great for those with money and isn’t doing great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple.
0	We need to call it out.
0	We need to attack it head on.
0	And we need to make structural change in our government, in our economy, and in our country.
0	So, in this period of time that I have been running for president, I’ve had more than 100 town halls.
0	I’ve taken more than 2,000 unfiltered questions.
0	And the single hardest questions I’ve gotten, I got one from a little boy and I got one from a little girl, and that is to say, when you’re president, how are you going to keep us safe?
0	That’s our responsibility as adults.
0	Seven children will die today from gun violence, children and teenagers.
0	And they won’t just die in mass shootings.
0	They’ll die on sidewalks, they’ll die in playgrounds, they’ll die in people’s backyards.
0	Gun violence is a national health emergency in this country.
0	And we need to treat it like that.
0	So what can we do?
0	We can do the things that are sensible.
0	We can do the universal background checks.
0	We can ban the weapons of war.
0	But we can also double down on the research and find out what really works, where it is that we can make the differences at the margins that will keep our children safe.
	We need to treat this like the virus that’s killing our children.
0	I do.
0	We are democracy.
0	And the way a democracy is supposed to work is the will of the people matters.
0	Now, we have for far too long have had a Congress in Washington that has just completely dismissed what people care about across this country.
0	They have made this country work much better than for those who can make giant contributions, made it work better for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers, and not made it work for the people.
0	Well, here’s how I see this happening.
0	Number one, sure, I want to see us get a Democratic majority in the Senate.
0	But short of a Democratic majority in the Senate, you better understand the fight still goes on.
0	It starts in the White House, and it means that everybody we energize in 2020 stays on the frontlines come January 2021.
0	We have to push from the outside, have leadership from the inside, and make this Congress reflect the will of the people.
0	Yes, first by taking away the filibuster from Mitch McConnell, to start with.
0	We have to do that.
0	Look it, look it, we are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change, and we are the last that can do something it.
0	Our towns are burning.
0	Our fields are flooding.
0	Miami is inundated.
0	And we have to understand, this is a climate crisis, an emergency (OFF-MIKE) this is our last chance in the administration, next one, to do something about it.
0	And we need to do what I’ve done in my state.
0	We’ve passed a 100 percent clean electrical grid bill.
0	We now have a vision statement.
0	And my plan has been called the gold standard of putting people to work.
0	But the most important thing on this, in the biggest decision for the American public is, who is going to make this the first priority?
0	And I am the candidate and the only one who’s saying this has to be the top priority of the United States, the organizing principle to mobilize the United States, so that we can do what we’ve always done, lead the world and invent the future and put 8 million people to work.
0	That’s what we’re going to do.
0	One of the most powerful pieces of art in the United States Capitol is the Trumbull painting of General George Washington resigning his commission to the Continental Congress, at the height of his power, submitting to the rule of law and the will of people.
0	That has withstood the test of time for the last 243 years.
0	If we set another precedent now that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power, a president who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy, if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity, then we will have set a new standard, and that is that some people, because of the position of power and public trust that they hold, are above the law.
0	And we cannot allow that to stand.
0	So we must begin impeachment now so that we have the facts and the truth and we follow them as far as they go and as high up as they reach and we save this democracy.
0	And if we’ve not been able to do that in this year or the year that follows, and under my administration, our Department of Justice will pursue these facts and ensure that there are consequences, there is accountability, and there is justice.
0	It’s the only way that we save this country.
0	Sure.
0	So, college affordability is personal for us.
0	Chasten and I have six figure student debt.
0	I believe in reducing student debt.
0	It’s logical to me that if you can refinance your house you ought to be able to refinance your student debt.
0	I also believe in free college for low and middle income students for whom cost could be a barrier.
0	I just don’t believe it makes sense to ask working class families to subsidize even the children of billionaires.
0	I think the children of the wealthiest Americans can pay at least a little bit of tuition.
0	And while I want — want tuition costs to go down I don’t think we can buy down every last penny for that.
0	Now, there’s something else that doesn’t get talked about in the college affordability debate.
0	Yes, it needs to be more affordable in this country to go to college.
0	It also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college.
0	You should be able to live well, afford rent, be generous to your children– (INAUDIBLE) little league whether you went to college or not.
0	That’s one of many reasons we need to raise the minimum wage to at least $15.00 an hour.
0	So, this is a very important issue.
0	So, the plan that Senator Sanders and I and other support Medicare for All is how you get to single payer, but it has a buy in transition period, which is really important.
0	In 2005 when I ran for Congress in a two to one republican district, I actually ran on Medicare for All and I won that two to one republican district twice.
0	And the way I formulated it was simple.
0	Anyone who doesn’t have access to insurance they like, they could buy it in a percentage of income they could afford.
0	So, that’s what we put into the transition period for our Medicare for All Plan.
0	I believe we need to get to universal healthcare as a right, not a privilege to single payer.
0	The quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers.
0	God bless the insurers if they want to compete, they can certainly try.
0	But, they’d never put people over their profits and I doubt they ever will.
0	So, what will happen is people will choose Medicare.
0	You will transition.
0	We would get to Medicare for All.
0	And then your step to single payer is so short.
0	I would make it an earned benefit just like Social Security, so that you buy in your whole life.
0	It is always there for you and it’s permanent and it’s universal.
0	Immediately on January 20th of 2021 I will first of all we cannot forget our DACA recipients so I’m going to start there.
0	I will immediately by executive action reinstate DACA status and DACA protection to those young people.
0	I will further extend protection for deferral of deportation for their parents and for veterans who we have so many who are undocumented and who have served our country and fought for our democracy.
0	I will also immediately put in place immediate process for reviewing the cases for asylum.
0	I will release children from cages.
0	I will get rid of the private detention centers.
0	And I will ensure that the–this microphone that the President of the United States holds in her hand is use din a way that is about reflecting the values of our country and not about locking children up, separating them from their parents.
0	And I have to just say that we have to think about this issue in terms of real people.
0	A mother who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin, through the entire country of Mexico facing unknown peril to come here why would that mother do that?
0	I will tell you.
0	Because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse.
0	But what does Donald Trump do?
0	He says go back to where you came from.
0	That is not reflective of our America and our values and it has got to end.
0	Okay.
0	So, on the issue of race, I couldn’t agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly.
0	I–there is not a black man I know, be he a relative, a friend or a coworker who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination.
0	Growing up, my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn’t play with us because she–because we were black.
0	And I will say also that–that in this campaign, we’ve also heard–and I’m going to now direct this to Vice President Biden.
0	I do not believe you are a racist and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.
0	Well, first, the economy.
0	We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity.
0	And Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what’s going on, when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums.
0	So I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids.
0	I do.
0	But I think my plan is a good one.
0	And my plan would be to, first of all, make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education.
0	My own dad and my sister got their first degrees with community college.
0	There’s many paths to success, as well as certifications.
0	Secondly, I’d used Pell grants.
0	I’d double them from $6,000 to $12,000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered, to families that make up to $100,000.
0	And then the third thing I would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans.
0	Because I can tell you this: If billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.
0	This economy has got to work for everyone.
0	And right now, we know that it isn’t.
0	And it’s going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does.
0	(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Right now, we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes.
0	That’s how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest.
0	A $2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality.
0	A new democracy that is revived because we’ve returned power to the people, no PACs, no gerrymandering, automatic and same-day voter registration to bring in more voters, and a new Voting Rights Act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now…
0	I don’t think I disagree.
0	I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation.
0	And you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from labor, and we have people that work full-time jobs and still can’t make a living wage.
0	We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs.
0	And you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that’s hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete.
0	One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector.
0	So I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work.
0	And I’ll tell you this.
0	I live in a low-income black and brown community.
0	I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans.
0	The indicators that are being used, from GDP to Wall Street’s rankings, is not helping people in my community.
0	It is about time that we have an economy that works for everybody, not just the wealthiest in our nation.
0	Thank you very much for that question, Lester.
0	You know, I grew up with a mother who raised my brother, Joaquin, and me as a single parent.
0	And I know what it’s like to struggle.
0	I know what it’s like to rent a home and to worry about whether you’re going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month and to see a mom work very, very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because they’re women.
0	I would do several things, starting with something we should have done a long time ago, which is to pass the Equal Rights Amendment finally in this country.
0	And also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country.
0	It’s past time that we did that.
0	And, you know, we have to do this.
0	If we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century, we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve.
0	Well, we’ve been addressing income inequality in New York City by raising wages, by raising benefits, by putting money back in the hands of working people, $15 minimum wage, paid sick days, pre-K for all, things that are making a huge difference in working people’s lives.
0	But let me tell you, what we’re hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle for the heart and soul of our party.
0	I want to make it clear.
0	This is supposed to be the party of working people.
0	Yes, we’re supposed to be for a 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy.
0	Yes, we’re supposed to be for free college, free public college, for our young people.
0	We are supposed to break up big corporations when they’re not serving our democracy.
0	This Democratic Party has to be strong and bold and progressive.
0	And in New York, we’ve proven that we can do something very different, we can put money back in the hands of working people.
0	And let me tell you, every time you talk about investing in people and their communities, you hear folks say there’s not enough money.
0	What I say to them every single time is, there’s plenty of money in this world, there’s plenty of money in this country.
0	It’s just in the wrong hands.
0	Democrats have to fix that.
0	(APPLAUSE)
0	Yes, I believe you can, but, first, let’s say the president came, he said don’t sell your house to people in Youngstown, Ohio.
0	And then his administration just in the last two years, we lost $4,000 — 4,000 jobs at a General Motors facility.
0	That rippled throughout our community.
0	General Motors got a tax cut.
0	General Motors got a bailout.
0	And then they have the audacity to move a new car that they’re going to produce to Mexico.
0	I’ve had family members that have to unbolt a machine from the factory floor, put it in a box, and ship it to China.
0	My area where I come from in northeast Ohio, this issue we’re talking about here, it’s been going on 40 years.
0	This is not a new phenomenon in the United States of America.
0	The bottom 60 percent haven’t seen a raise since 1980.
0	Meanwhile, the top 1 percent control 90 percent of the wealth.
0	We need an industrial policy saying we’re going to dominate building electric vehicles, there’s going to be 30 million made in the next 10 years.
0	I want half of them made in the United States.
0	I want to dominate the solar industry…
0	Well, I think it’s a bold approach.
0	It’s something that Barack Obama wanted to do when we were working on the Affordable Care Act.
0	And that is a public option.
0	I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in four years, which is exactly what this bill says.
0	So let me go on beyond that.
0	There is a much bigger issue in addition to that, and that is pharmaceuticals.
0	The president literally went on TV, on Fox, and said that people’s heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices.
0	Instead, 2,500 drugs have gone up in double-digits since he came into office.
0	Instead, he gave $100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies.
0	For the rest of us, for the rest of America, that’s what we call at home all foam and no beer.
0	We got nothing out of it.
0	And so my proposal is to do something about pharma, to take them on, to allow negotiation under Medicare, to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries.
0	And pharma thinks they own Washington?
0	Well, they don’t own me.
1	It should not be an option in the United States of America for any insurance company to deny a woman coverage for their exercise of their right of choice.
1	And I am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a woman’s right of reproductive health in health insurance, and I’m the only candidate who has passed a public option.
1	And I respect everybody’s goals and plans here, but we do have one candidate that’s actually advanced the ball.
1	And we’ve got to have access for everyone.
1	I’ve done it as a public option.
1	Your time…
1	Senator Klobuchar, I want to get you…
1	That’s a false claim.
1	I am fascinated by this.
1	Senator — Senator Klobuchar?
1	I just want to say, there’s three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a woman’s right to choose.
1	I’ll start with that.
1	And then I just want to make very clear, I think we share the goal of universal health care.
1	And the idea I put out there, the public option, which the governor was just talking about, this idea is that you use Medicare or Medicaid without any insurance companies involved, you can do it either way.
1	And the estimates are 13 million people would see a reduction in their premiums, 12 more million people would get covered.
1	So I think it is a beginning and the way you start and the way you move to universal health care.
1	Secretary Castro, this one is for you.
1	All of you on stage support a woman’s right to an abortion.
1	You all support some version of a government health care option.
1	Would your plan cover abortion, Mr. Secretary?
1	Yes, it would.
1	I don’t believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice.
1	And, you know, what that means is that just because a woman — or let’s also not forget someone in the trans community, a trans female, is poor, doesn’t mean they shouldn’t have the right to exercise that right to choose.
1	And so I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion.
1	More than that, everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today, a person’s right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri, in Alabama, in Georgia.
1	I would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of Roe v.
1	Wade and will respect it.… and in addition to that, make sure that we fight hard as we transition our health care system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right.
1	Senator Warren, would you put limits on — any limits on abortion?
1	I would make certain that every woman has access to the full range of reproductive health care services, and that includes birth control, it includes abortion, it includes everything for a woman.
1	And I want to add on that.
1	It’s not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us.
1	Forty-seven years ago, Roe v.
1	Wade was decided, and we’ve all looked to the courts all that time, as state after state has undermined Roe, has put in exceptions, has come right up to the edge of taking away protections.
1	Your time is up, Senator.
1	They should absolutely be held criminally liable, because they are liable and responsible.
1	This is one of the reasons why well before I was running for president I said I would not take contributions from pharma companies, not take contributions from corporate PACs, or pharma executives, because they are part of this problem.
1	And this opioid addiction in our country, we in cities like mine have been seeing how we’ve tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long.
1	It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that.
1	Congressman O’Rourke, how would you deal with it?
1	Tonight in this country, you have 2.3 million of our fellow Americans behind bars.
1	It’s the largest prison population on the face of the planet.
1	Many are there for nonviolent drug crimes, including possession of marijuana, at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized it.
1	And yet despite what Purdue Pharma has done, their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we’re seeing throughout this country, they’ve been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences, not a single night in jail.
1	Unless there’s accountability and justice, this crisis will continue.
1	In my administration, we will hold them to account.
1	We will make sure that they pay a price, and we will help those who’ve been victims of this malfeasance in this country get them treatment and long-term care.
1	Thank you very much, Jose.
1	I’m very proud that in April I became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan.
1	And we saw those images… … watching that image of Oscar and his daughter, Valeria, is heartbreaking.
1	It should also piss us all off.
1	If I were president today — and it should spur us to action.
1	If I were president today, I would sign an executive order that would get rid of Trump’s zero-tolerance policy, the remain in Mexico policy, and the metering policy — this metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river.
1	They had been playing games with people who are coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry.
1	Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry, and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim, so they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river, and they died because of that.
1	On day one.
1	Sorry, I’m just going to ask…
1	On day one, I would do that executive order that would address metering.
1	And then I would follow that up in my first 100 days with immigration reform that would honor asylum claims, that would put undocumented immigrants, as long as they haven’t committed a serious crime, on a pathway to citizenship.
1	And then we’d get to the root cause of the issue, which is we need a Marshall Plan for Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of coming to the United States to seek it.
1	Senator Booker, what would you do on day one?
1	And this is a situation that the next president will inherit.
1	Yes.
1	(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) On day one, I will make sure that, number one, we end the ICE policies and the Customs and Border Policies that are violating the human rights.
1	When people come to this country, they do not leave their human rights at the border.
1	Number two…I will make sure that we reinstate DACA, that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for DACA recipients, and to make sure that people that are here on temporary protective status can stay and remain here.
1	And then, finally, we need to make sure that we address the issues that made Oscar and Valeria come in the first place, by making major investments in the Northern Triangle, not like this president is doing, by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem.
1	We cannot surrender our values and think that we’re going to get border security.
1	We actually will lose security and our values.
1	We must fight for both.
1	… if I might — if I might, very briefly, and this is an important point.
1	You know, my plan — and I’m glad to see that Senator Booker, Senator Warren, and Governor Inslee agree with me on this.
1	My plan also includes getting rid of Section 1325 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, to go back to the way we used to treat this when somebody comes across the border, not to criminalize desperation, to treat that as a civil violation.
1	And here’s why it’s important.
1	We see all of this horrendous family separation.
1	They use that law, Section 1325, to justify under the law separating little children from their families.
1	Thank you.
1	Jose…
1	And so I want to challenge every single candidate on this stage to support the repeal of Section 1325.
1	Thirty seconds.
1	As my friend here said, I agree with him on that issue, but folks should understand that the 	It happens in our communities, as ICE are ripping away parents from their American children, spouses and the like, and are creating fear in cities all across this country where parents are afraid to even drop their kids off to school or go to work.
1	We must end those policies, as well.
1	We have to change the discussion about in this country…
1	Mayor?
1	… because look at the bottom line here.
1	Those tragic — that tragic photo of those — that parent, that child — and I’m saying this as a father.
1	Every American should feel that in their heart, every American should say that is not America, those are not our values.
1	But we have to get under the skin of why we have this crisis in our system, because we’re not being honest about the division that’s been fomented in this country.
1	The way that American citizens have been told that immigrants somehow created their misery and their pain and their challenges, for all the American citizens out there who feel you’re falling behind or feel the American dream is not working for you, the immigrants didn’t do that to you.
1	The big corporations did that to you.
1	The 1 percent did that to you.
1	We need to be the party of working people, and that includes a party of immigrants.
1	But first we have to tell working people in America who are hurting that we’re going to be on their side every single time against those big corporations who created this mess to begin with.
1	And remind people we’re all in this together.
1	If we don’t change that debate, that politics that’s holding us back, we won’t get all these reforms people are talking about.
1	That’s what we need to do as Democrats.
1	If I could, I’m sorry.
1	(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) What would you do, Congressman, day one at the White House??
1	(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) We would not turn back Valeria and her father, Oscar.
1	We would accept them into this country and follow our own asylum laws.
1	We would not build walls.
1	We would not put kids in cages.
1	In fact, we would spare no expense to reunite the families that have been separated already…
1	… and we would not criminally prosecute any family who is fleeing violence and persecution…
1	… repeal of Section 1325.
1	We would make sure…
1	Secretary, let him finish.
1	And I will give you…
1	But let him finish.
1	Let him finish.
1	We would not detain any family fleeing violence, in fact, fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet today.
1	We would implement a family case management program so they could be cared for in the community at a fraction of the cost.
1	And then we would rewrite our immigration laws in our own image, free Dreamers forever from any fear of deportation by making them U.S. citizens here in this country, invest in solutions in Central America, work with regional stakeholders so there’s no reason to make that 2,000 mile journey to this country.
1	Thank you.
1	Secretary, I’ll give you 30 seconds.
1	Let’s be very clear.
1	The reason that they’re separating these little children from their families is that they’re using Section 1325 of that act which criminalizes coming across the border to incarcerate the parents and then separate them.
1	Some of us on this stage have called to end that section, to terminate it.
1	Some, like Congressman O’Rourke, have not.
1	And I want to challenge all of the candidate to do that.
1	I just think it’s a mistake, Beto.
1	I think it’s a mistake.
1	And I think that — that if you truly want to change the system, that we’ve got to repeal that section.
1	If not…
1	Thank you.
1	… then it might as well be the same policy.
1	Let me respond to this very briefly.
1	As a member of a Congress, I helped to introduce legislation that would ensure that we don’t criminalize those who are seeking asylum and refuge in this country.
1	I’m not talking about — I’m not talking about the ones that are seeking asylum.
1	If you’re fleeing — if you’re fleeing desperation, then I want to make sure…
1	I’m talking about — I’m talking about everybody else.
1	… I want to make sure you are treated with respect.
1	I’m still talking about everybody else.
1	But you’re looking at just one small part of this.
1	I’m talking about a comprehensive rewrite of our immigration laws.
1	That’s not true.
1	And if you do that, I don’t think it’s asking too much for people to follow our laws when they come to this country.
1	That’s actually not true.
1	I’m talking about millions of folks — a lot of folks that are coming are not seeking asylum.
1	A lot of them are undocumented immigrants, right?
1	And you said recently that the reason you didn’t want to repeal Section 1325 was because you were concerned about human trafficking and drug trafficking.
1	But let me tell you what: Section 18, title 18 of the U.S. code, title 21 and title 22, already cover human trafficking.
1	I think that you should do your homework on this issue.
1	If you did your homework on this issue, you would know that we should repeal this section.
1	This is an issue that we should and could be talking about for a long time, and we will for a long time.
1	Can we talk about the conditions about why people are coming here?
1	Let’s — Lester — Lester — I’m sorry, Savannah — I know, it’s just — we could go on.
1	But rather than talk about specific provisions, we really have to talk about why these people are coming to our country…
1	You’ll get your chance.
1	… and what we’re going to do to actually make a difference in these countries.
1	Congressman, you’ll get your chance.
1	Let’s continue the discussion.
1	Senator Klobuchar…
1	Yes.
1	Let’s talk about what Secretary Castro just said.
1	He wants to no longer have it be a crime to illegally cross the border.
1	Do you support that?
1	Do you think it should be a civil offense only?
1	And if so, do you worry about potentially incentivizing people to come here?
1	Immigrants, they do not diminish America.
1	They are America.
1	And I am happy to look at his proposal.
1	But I do think you want to make sure that you have provisions in place that allow you to go after traffickers and allow you to go after people who are violating the law.
1	What I really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here.
1	And that is that 70 of our Fortune 500 companies are headed by people that came from other countries.
1	Twenty-five percent of our U.S. Nobel laureates were born in other countries.
1	We have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories.
1	We need them to start small businesses.
1	We need their ideas.
1	And this president has literally gone backwards at a time when our economy needs immigrants.
1	And so my proposal is to look at that 2013 bill that passed the Senate with Republican support, to upgrade that bill, to make it as good as possible and get it done.
1	It brings the doubt down by $158 billion.
1	Senator…
1	It gives a path for citizenship for citizen — for people who can become citizens.
1	And it will be so much better for our economy in America.
1	Senator, that’s time.
1	Thank you.
1	Congressman Ryan, same question.
1	Should it be a crime to illegally cross the border?
1	Or should it be a civil offense only?
1	Well, I agree with Secretary Castro.
1	I think there are other provisions in the law that will allow you to prosecute people for coming over here if they’re dealing drugs and other things.
1	That’s already established in the law.
1	So there’s no need to repeat it.
1	And I think it’s abhorrent — we’re talking about this father who got killed with his daughter, and the issues here — the way these kids are being treated.
1	If you go to Guantanamo Bay, there are terrorists that are held that get better health care than those kids that have tried to cross the border in the United States.
1	That needs to stop.
1	And I think the president should immediately ask doctors and nurses to go immediately down to the border and start taking care of these kids.
1	What kind of country are we running here where we have a president of the United States who’s so focused on hate and fear and division?
1	And what has happened now, the end result is now we’ve got kids literally laying in their own snot, with three-week-old diapers that haven’t been changed.
1	We’ve got to tell this president that is not a sign of strength, Mr. President.
