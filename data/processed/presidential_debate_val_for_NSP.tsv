President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments.
You talked about taking a therapeutic.
I assume you're referencing Regeneron.
You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks.
Is that a guarantee?
It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance.
One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.
Can you tell us what companies?
Johnson and Johnson is doing very well.
Moderna is doing very well.
Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others.
And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.
Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now.
Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022.
Is your timeline realistic?
No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate.
I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics.
And this is a very easy distribution for him.
He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.
Vice President Biden, your reaction?
Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government.
What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?
Make sure it's totally transparent.
Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes.
And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time.
This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer.
We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.
President Trump, your reaction?
He says you have no plan.
I don’t think it’s going to be a dark winter at all.
We're opening up our country.
We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning.
When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon.
Now he's saying, ‘Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.’ But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me.
And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster.
Far less lethal.
But it was a total disaster.
Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease.
Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said ‘It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.’ Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this.
Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.
Vice President Biden, your response?
My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China.
And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that.
In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was.
What did the President say in January?
He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent.
We owe him a debt of gratitude.
We have to thank him.
And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people.
And again, I go back to this, he had nothing.
He did virtually nothing.
And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, ‘Oh, don't worry.
This is all going to be over soon.’ Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon.
President Trump, your reaction?
I did not say over soon.
I say we're learning to live with it.
We have no choice.
We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does.
He has the ability to lock himself up.
I don’t know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement.
People can’t do that.
By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that.
I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears.
I can't do that.
And here’s — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything.
I said, you know, this is dangerous.
And you catch it.
And you know, I caught it.
I learned a lot.
I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals.
And now, I recovered.
99.9 of young people recover.
99% of people recover.
We have to recover.
We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation.
And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it.
Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though.
Can I respond to that?
30 seconds please, and then I have a question.
Number one.
He says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it.
People are learning to die with it.
You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning.
That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone.
Learning to live with it?
Come on.
We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous.
When's the last time?
Is it really dangerous, still?
Are we dangerous?
Tell the people, is it dangerous now?
What should they do about the danger?
And you say, I take no responsibility.
Let me talk about —
Excuse me.
Very quickly.
I take full responsibility.
It's not my fault that it came here.
It's China's fault.
You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either.
It's China's fault.
They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves
Vice President Biden.
as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit.
The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — What happened?
What did the President say?
He said don't worry, it's going to go away, it’s going to be gone by Easter.
Don't worry, the warm weather.
Don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious.
A whole range of things the President said.
And even today, he thinks we are in control.
We're about to lose 200,000 more people
President Trump.
Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this.
When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed.
And that went on for months.
What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing.
She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco.
But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing.
You’re xenophobic.
I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China.
Now he says I should have closed it earlier.
It just Joe, it doesn't —
I didn't say either of those things.
You certainly did.
I talked about his xenophobia in a different context.
It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.
All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this.
He thought I shouldn't have closed the border.
That’s obvious.
Do you wanna respond to that quickly, vice president?
No.
OK, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this.
Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it.
What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?
What I would say is I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country.
It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they're concerned.
Those other concerns are real.
That's why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.
You haven't ruled out more shutdowns
Oh no, I'm not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards.
The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up.
More social distancing.
Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums.
Do not open until you get this under control, under more control.
But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely.
For example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open.
They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now
Let's talk about schools.
President Trump —
Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.
Please, and then I have a follow up.
Thank you, and I appreciate that.
Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him.
His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying.
They're dying.
And he supports all these people.
All he talks about is shutdowns No, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools.
And it's like, as an example, I have a young son.
He also tested positive.
By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away.
Young people, I guess it’s their immune system.
Let me follow up, President Trump.
You've demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely.
But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike.
What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?
I want to open the schools.
The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools.
We have to open our country.
We're not going to have a country.
You can't do this, we can't keep this country closed.
It is a massive country with a massive economy.
People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide.
There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before.
There's abuse, tremendous abuse.
We have to open our country.
You know I've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down.
He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.
Vice President Biden, your —
Simply not true.
We're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.
We ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open.
You need to be able to, for example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business.
You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another.
You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected.
You need to be able to trace.
You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we open safely.
And by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly.
I will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to New York, ut's a ghost town.
It's a ghost town.
And when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying.
These are businesses with no money.
Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer.
I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic?
These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city.
For so many years, I loved it.
It was vibrant.
It's dying.
Everyone's leaving New York.
Vice President.
New York has lost more than 40,000 people.
11,000 people in nursing.
President Trump, what about —
When you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed.
Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything.
It's been like a prison.
Now it was just ruled unconstitutional.
Take a look at North Carolina.
They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially.
We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen.
We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them.
We have the best testing in the world by far.
That's why we have so many cases.
Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section.
President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, “a disaster.” You described him and other medical experts as “idiots.” If you're not listening to them, who are you listening to?
I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony.
I get along very well with Anthony.
But he did say, ‘don't wear masks.’ He did say, as you know, ‘this is not going to be a problem.’ I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay.
He said, ‘this is not going to be a problem.
We are not going to have a problem at all.’ When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others.
And I'm not knocking him.
Nobody knew.
Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was.
We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, ‘don't wear masks.’ Now he wants to wear masks.
Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words: ‘This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.’ So he's allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.
Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then we're going to move on to the next section.
My response is think about what the President knew in January and didn't tell the American people.
He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu.
He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us, didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic.
He didn't want us — Americans don't panic.
He panicked.
Well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, ‘this is a really dangerous thing,’ and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — had said, ‘sell short, because we gotta get moving.
It's a dangerous problem.’
Well this is —
I’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we're gonna move on.
I don't know if somebody went to Wall Street.
You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street.
I don't take it.
You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money.
And every time you raise money, deals are made.
I could raise so much more money.
As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record.
But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position.
And then you bring up Wall Street?
You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street.
Because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me.
I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe.
We don't need money.
We have plenty of money.
In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get.
Don’t tell me about wall street.
All right, gentlemen, we're gonna move on.
Average contribution, $43.
	
Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered.
Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia.
And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife.
He got three and a half million dollars.
Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half?
I never got any money from Russia.
I don't get money from Russia.
Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is a fantastic DNI — he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose.
Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia.
Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia.
Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO.
You know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against Russia.
I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine.
There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.
And I'll tell you, they were so bad.
They took over the, the submarine port.
You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama.
They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine.
You handed it to them.
But you were getting a lot of money from Russia.
They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse.
All of the emails, the emails are horrible.
The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family.
And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening.
And it should have never happened.
And I think you owe an explanation to the American people.
Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning.
And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people.
Maybe you can do it right now.
Vice President Biden, you may respond to follow up on the election security.
I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life.
We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money?
I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one.
Number two, this is a president — I have released all of my tax returns.
22 years.
Go look at them.
22 years of my tax return.
You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return.
What are you hiding?
Why are you unwilling?
The foreign countries are paying you a lot.
Russia is paying you a lot.
China is paying a lot.
And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world.
And China's building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas.
So what's going on here?
Why don't you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption?
President Trump, your response.
First of all, I called my accounts — under audit.
I'm going to release them as soon as we can.
I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is.
But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750.
I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay?
They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars.
I prepaid my tax.
Tens.
Over the last number of years.
Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate.
They think I may have to pay tax.
So, I already prepaid it.
Nobody told me that.
Did your accountant tell you —
Excuse me.
And it wasn't written whenever they write this.
They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee.
But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one.
Number two, I don't make money from China, you do.
I don't make money from Ukraine, you do.
I don't make money from Russia.
You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you.
They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man.
You're the big man, I think.
I don't know, maybe you're not.
But you're the big man, I think.
You son said that we have to give 10% to the big man.
Joe, what's that all about?
It's terrible.
All right, gentlemen, I want to ask you both some questions about all of this.
I'm gonna let you both respond, very quickly.
You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes.
Did he tell you when you can release them?
Do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the American people?
I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated.
A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly.
We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president.
I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done.
As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it.
But I have paid millions and millions of dollars.
And it's worse than paying.
I paid in advance.
It's called prepaying your taxes.
I paid.
I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly.
At some point I want to respond.
Respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question.
Why do he — He's been saying this for four years.
Show us.
Just show us.
Stop playing around.
You’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes.
Nobody knows, Mr. President, they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that are so low.
When last time he said what he paid, he said, ‘I only pay that little because I'm smart.
I know how to game the system.’ Come on, come on, folks.
Quickly, President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you.
I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years.
It started before I even got elected.
They spied on my campaign.
No president should ever have to go through what I went through.
Let me just say this.
Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent, $48 million.
They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong.
$48 million.
I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars.
Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe.
And they say you get some of it.
And you do live very well.
You have houses all over the place.
You live very well.
All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly.
Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President.
In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?
Nothing was unethical.
Here's what the deal.
With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong.
Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably.
I carried out US policy.
Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line.
Not a single thing, number one.
Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened.
My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — China.
I have not had it.
The only guy that made money from China is this guy.
He’s the only one.
Nobody else has made money from China.
Let me ask my question to you.
Could I just — one thing.
Very quickly.
His son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that.
And he didn't have a job.
As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month.
Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience.
That’s 100% dishonest.
I’m going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then I have a question for you.
No basis for that.
Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.
OK, President Trump, this is for you.
Since you took office, you've never divested from your business.
You've personally promoted your properties abroad.
A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China.
So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?
I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place.
I mean, I was a businessman doing business.
The bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013.
That's what it was.
It was opened.
It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it.
And I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.
OK.
Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that.
That was before.
So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference.
He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something —
We do need to move on.
I do want to ask you, Vice President Biden, about China.
Let's talk about China more broadly.
There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus.
If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like?
All right, let's talk about North Korea.
Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this.
OK, very quickly and then we're gonna have...
His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China —
Not true.
after spending 10 minutes in office and being an Air Force Two, number one.
Number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.
That is not true.
President Trump, on China policy, though.
What are you gonna do?
What specifically are you going to do to make China pay?
First of all, China is paying.
They’re paying billions and billions of dollars.
I just gave $28 billion.
Through sanctions?
I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.
Taxpayers money.
It’s what?
Taxpayers money.
No, the taxpayers.
It's called China.
Not true.
China pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe?
They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money?
Our farmers.
Our great farmers, because they would target it.
You never charge them anything.
Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry.
We were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry
OK, Vice President Biden, your response, please?
This isn't about me.
There's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey.
There's a reason for it.
He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues.
It's not about his family and my family.
It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly.
If you're making less than, if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly right now.
You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they’re bald, because we have to wait another month.
Or, so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage?
Who's going to tell her, she can't go back to community college?
They're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymot.
They're in trouble.
We should be talking about your families but that's the last thing he wants to talk about.
I wanted to say, I want to tell —
That is a typical statement.
Just 10 seconds, please.
10 seconds Mr President, 10 seconds.
Just a typical political statement.
Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything.
Just a typical politician when I see that.
All right, let’s talk —
I’m not a typical politician, that’s why I got elected.
Let’s talk about —
Let’s get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table.
Come on, Joe, you can do better.
We're gonna talk about North Korea now.
President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's three times.
You've talked about your beautiful letters with him, you've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal.
Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship?
Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic.
Vice President Biden, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration.
Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?
Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because here's the root.
I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, they said, ‘Why are you moving your missile defense up so close?
Why are you moving more forces?
Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea?’ I said, ‘Because North Korea is a problem.
And we're going to continue to do it so we can control them.
We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us.
And so if you want to do something about it, step up.
And help if not, it's going to continue.’ What has he done?
He's legitimized North Korea, he's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we're better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before.
Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden, you've said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions.
Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?
On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there.
The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.
All right, let's move on to American families.
Kristen, they tried to meet with him.
Very quickly.
10 seconds, President Trump.
They tried to meet with him, he wouldn’t do it.
He didn’t like Obama.
He didn’t like him.
He wouldn’t do it.
OK, I’ve got to give him a chance to respond.
They tried, he wouldn’t do it.
And that’s okay.
You know what, North Korea, we’re not in a war.
We have a good relationship.
You know, people don’t understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.
President Trump, we have to move on.
We have a lot of questions to get through.
We had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe, the rest of Europe.
Come on.
The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we’re gonna talk about denuclearization, we’re not gonna legitimize you, we’re gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you.
That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us.
And it didn’t happen.
Let’s move on and talk about American families.
Excuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen.
They left me a mess.
North Korea was a mess.
We need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, President Trump.
Remember the first two or three months.
There was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit.
They left us a mess, and Obama would be – I think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had.
	
I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden, it relates to something that President Trump said.
He's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine.
What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government?
What he’s saying, it's ridiculous.
It’s like saying that, you know, we're the idea that, the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes the socialist plan?
Look, the difference between the president -- I think health care is not a privilege, it's a right.
Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care.
And I am very proud of my plan.
It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field.
This is something that's going to save people's lives.
And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in God's name are you going to do if you get sick?
Because you've lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company's gone under.
We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what I do.
President Trump, your response.
Excuse me, he was there for 47 years -- he didn't do it.
He was now there as Vice President for eight years.
And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters.
It was just a little while ago, right?
Less than four years ago.
He didn't do anything.
He didn't do it.
He wants socialized medicine.
And it's not that he wants it, his vice president -- I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more, Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it.
You're going to have socialized medicine.
Just like you went on with fracking -- ‘We're not going to have fracking, we're going to stop fracking, we're going to stop fracking.’ Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination -- well he got very lucky to get it.
And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, ‘Oh, we're gonna have fracking.’ And you never asked a question.
And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say.
But by the way, somebody should ask the question.
He goes for a year --
We do have a number of -- we have a number of topics.
No, no, but that's a question --
We're gonna get to it --
It’s the same thing with socialized medicine.
Vice President, your response.
My response is people deserve to have affordable health care -- period.
Period, period, period.
And the Bidencare proposal will, in fact, provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums.
What we're going to do is going to cost some money; it's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it.
And they're going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly.
He keeps talking about it.
He hasn't done a thing for anybody on health care, not a thing.
Kristen, when he says --
Very quickly, then I want to talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill
When he says public health option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care.
When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying -- he’s destroying your Social Security.
And this whole country will come down.
You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state.
His governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work --
Let's see if --
-- it was impossible --
Vice President Biden, your response.
He thinks he's running against someone else.
He's running against Joe Biden.
I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them.
Joe Biden, he's running against.
And the idea that we're in a situation and want to destroy Medicare -- this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, ‘If in fact’ -- and, social security -- ‘If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to pay for it.
This is a guy who's tried to cut Medicare.
So I don't know.
I mean, the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare?
Come on.
He tried to get rid of --
Vice Presiden, Mr. President, I’m going to have to go on to another question --
-- he tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago.
Go back and look at the records.
He tried to hurt Social Security you've got --
All right, let’s move on to the next question.
They say the stock market will rule if I'm elected.
If he's elected, the stock market will crash.
OK, let's move on to the next question.
May I respond?
Very quickly.
The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening.
Where I come from, in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market.
Just in the last three, three years during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to the Wall Street, $700 billion more dollars.
$700 billion more dollars.
Because that's his only measure.
What happens to the ordinary people out there?
What happens to them?
401k’s are through the roof.
401k --
All right, let’s move on.
-- are through the roof.
And he doesn't come from Scranton.
That's like, what --  he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew --
We're gonna move on --
And he left.
And the people of Pennsylvania will tell you that.
to my next question, gentlemen.
As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work.
And as of tonight, 8 million more homes have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day.
Those hit hardest are women and people of color.
They see Washington fighting over a relief bill.
Mr. President, why haven't you been able to get them the help they  need?
30 seconds here.
Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it.
I do.
But you're the president.
I do.
But I still have to get, unfortunate -- that's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her.
Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything.
She'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3.
Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it.
We are ready, willing and able to do something.
Don't forget, we've already approved three plans.
And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness.
This one she doesn't want.
It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically.
I think it hurts her politically.
All right, Mr. Vice President --
You know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can't -- he will not pass it.
He does not have Republican votes.
Why isn’t he talking to his Republican friends?
Let me follow up with you, Vice President
If we made a deal, we’d have --
Let me ask Vice President Biden the question.
You are the leader of the Democratic Party.
Why have you not [] Democrats to get a deal for the American people?
Well, I have and they have pushed it.
Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer.
This is like -- it's not new.
It's been out there.
The HEROES Act has been sitting there.
And look at what's happening.
When I was in charge of the Recovery Act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets, so then they have to fire fire -- they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they can keep their cities and counties running.
He will not support that.
They have not done a thing for them.
And Mitch McConnell said, ‘Let him go bankrupt.
Let him go bankrupt.’ Come on.
What's the matter with these --
I want --
All right, if I get elected, I'm not gonna -- I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president.
I don't see red states and blue states.
What I see is American United States.
And folks, every single state out there finds themselves in trouble.
They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue.
Cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers -- because they have to balance their budget.
And the founders were smart.
They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.
I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen.
Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners today.
Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage?
You, of course, support a $15 minimum wage.
I do, because I think one of the things we’re gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too.
We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses.
You’ve got one in six of them going under.
They're not going to be able to make it back.
They passed a package that allows us to be able to call PPP, money that’s supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely.
Schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in.
They need the help, the businesses, as well as the schools, need the help.
But this, these guys will not help them.
He is not giving them any of the money.
We are going to move on --
For small businesses -- by raising the minimum wage and helping, I think it should be a state option.
Alabama is different than New York, New York is different from Vermont.
Every state is different.
It should be a state option.
So it's very important.
We have to help our small business --
You said --
How are you helping small businesses, when you're forcing wages.
What's going to happen and what's been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen
Well you said you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour --
Say again?
You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
Is that still the case?
What I’d really like, I would consider it to an extent.
I really like what I -- in a second administration -- but not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business.
It should be a state option.
Look, I have a read on different places, I know different places.
They’re all different.
Some places, $15 is not so bad.
In other places, other states, $15 --
OK, President Trump, thank you.
Quick response, Vice President Biden
Two jobs, one job below poverty.
People are making 6, 7, 8 bucks an hour.
These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street, because they've allowed us to make it.
What's happening?
They deserve a minimum wage of $15.
Anything below that put you below the poverty level.
And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, business has gone out of business.
That is simply not true.

Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it’s easy to use them to get into our country.
We now have a stronger border as we've ever had.
We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally.
	
I do.
I do.
You know, my daughter is a social worker.
And she's written a lot about this.
She's got a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work.
So, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on.
When I didn't -- I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel.
And don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you.
But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just Yes or No sir, just hands on top of the wheel.
Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps.
The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America.
And we have always said we've never lived up to it.
Do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal?
Guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it.
We have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion.
This is the first president come along and says that's the end of that.
We're not going to do that anymore.
We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses.
All the things we can do.
And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things.
Just to give people a shot.
It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.

So we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs.
I do love the environment, but what I want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air.
We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time.
Not Joe.
I haven't heard him use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it.
And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years.
Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can’t do-- Look at China, how filthy it is.
Look at Russia.
Look at India.
It's filthy.
The air is filthy.
The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly.
When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice.
They were going to take away our businesses.
I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord.
It was so unfair.
China doesn't kick in until 2030.
Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away.
It would-- It would have been-- It would have destroyed our businesses.
So, you ready?
We have done an incredible job environmentally.
We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.
Climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity.
We have a moral obligation to deal with it.
And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don't have much time.
We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years.
Four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up-- to limit the-- limit of admissions will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble.
Here's where we have a great opportunity, I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan.
Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs.
We're going to invest in, for example, 500,000-- 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future.
In the meantime, China's doing that.
We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs.
And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment.
Our health and our jobs are at stake.
That's what's happening.
And we-- right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan-- My plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his.
This from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy.
The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made.
If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nice times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely.
Nine times more.
Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money.
Economically, we saved it.
And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic.
We saved it.
We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back.
We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline.
Remember that.
	
We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China.
Now we're rebuilding it and we're doing record numbers,  11.4 million jobs in a short period of time etc..
But, I will tell you, go back before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me.
They wanted to get together.
We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country, Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas MIT graduates, number one in the class-- everybody had the best numbers.
And you know what?
The other side wanted to get together.
They wanted to unify.
Success is going to bring us together.
We are on the road to success.
But I’m cutting taxes and he wants to raise everybody’s taxes.
And he wants to put new regulations on everything.
He will kill it.
If he gets in, you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen.
Your 401K's will go to hell and it'll be a very, very sad day for this country.
We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China.
Now we're rebuilding it and we're doing record numbers,  11.4 million jobs in a short period of time etc..
I will say, ‘I’m the American president.
I represent all of you whether you voted for me or against me.
And I'm going to make sure that you’re represented.
I’m going to give you hope.
We're going to move.
We're going to choose science over fiction.
We're going to choose hope over fear.
We're going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make things better.
We can grow this economy.
We can deal with a systemic racism.
At the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run, and moved, and motivated by clean energy, creating millions of new jobs.
And that's the fact, that's what we're going to do.
And I'm going to say, as I said at the beginning, what is on the ballot here is the character of this country.
Decency.
Honor.
Respect.
Treating people with dignity.
Making sure that everyone has an even chance.
Now, I'm going to make sure you get that.
You haven't been getting it the last four years.
I will say, ‘I’m the American president.
I represent all of you whether you voted for me or against me.
